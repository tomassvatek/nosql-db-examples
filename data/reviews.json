       "text":"Not the \"nice seafood restaurant\" my wife wanted for dinner. It's more like a lunch spot. Breading on the fish was super thin and tasteless. The fish itself was thin and a rubbery. The shrimp were severely overcooked. The slaw was nothing more than shredded cabbage with dressing and some type of seeds in it. Not sure what they were but there was way too much and they had a bitter taste. I like my fish and chips to be thick and flakey. This was about 1\/4 inch thick and 3 inches wide. Might make a good sandwich if the breading had some seasoning, they weren't over cooked, and u layered them. Not even sure what fish I ended up with because they were out of so many items. I think it was the swai (catfish) and something else. If u plan on going, call ahead to see what they are out of. As other reviewers have noted, the fries were very good. I would come again JUST for the fries. Overall though, it was a disappointment. Not bad enough to complain about and send back, but almost. Sorry to be so harsh...",

Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Glad I tried it though. \n\nI went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a \"must go\" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person)\n\nThey did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that.\n\nOh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee. If you don't care for trying their dinner. Do yourself a favor and at least go for coffee and dessert. Great coffee and an amazing cream puff!",

I'd cross a mountain to get to Sapporo. \n\nMomofuku and Baohaus have ruined Pork Buns for me, and I never thought I'd find decent ones in Boston. But at $5.50 for two, Sapporo's are a steal. And better than decent. Done deal.\nMiso has never been my favorite, but the Spicy Miso Ramen gives me a run for my money. Soft, dense grains of the white stuff glide down your throat, and if you add a red-hot kick of chili, you really start to taste the spicy ground pork. Yum.\nI've had no broth more perfect than the Kimchee Ramen with its chewy al dente noodles. The kimchee packs some punch, and an addition of spicy ground pork is just perfect.\n\nI never want to go to Porter Square, but it takes about the same amount of time to get to as Allston's Super 88, the only food court that rival the Shops so if you say Sapporo I'll come running. So keep up the good work Sapporo, I think you also put Lesley University on the map.",

       "text":"I love ramen like a fat kid loves cake. I consider myself to be a ramen connoisseur of sorts. As far as flavor goes, Sapporo ramen is in the big leagues. The noodle consistency is great and the broth is lava hot. There are a couple of things that bug though:\n\n1) Invariably, with pretty much any flavor ramen you order, but possibly more with the \"butter ramen,\" there is a 3mm layer of oil that sits right on top of all that fragrant broth. I always forget about it, which is probably why I keep on going back for more, but am reminded every time I'm presented with the bowl, that I should have brought with me one of those oil separator measuring cups.\n\n2) At 7 bucks for the bare minimum shoyu ramen, I wish there was more ramen -- not to mention, one week that I went there, it seemed as if the price went UP while simultaneously, once slice of pork went away forever, never to grace my bowl again. How how u gonna play that off? Raise the price and take 1\/4 of the meat away? That's just wrong.\n\n3) This being the only ramen place in 4 square miles, it gets crowded. That means you will have to share a table with someone, and this person or persons (it could be a whole family) will be sitting very very close to you. You will know about all their personal affairs by the time the meal is over.",

Our waiter was Mike T and he had a great personality and was very speedy.  I ordered Vanilla Cream Puff, which I didn't really need....but wanted.  I also ordered a Mint Hot Chocolate which was such a scrumptious way to wash it down with.  Boyfriend ordered slice of German Chocolate Cake with side of ice cream and he ordered Hot Buttered Rum.  There was a 2 man band playing accordion and drums which was a great way to unwind after a disappointing meal elsewhere.  I did walk around the buffet on my way out the door and it looks sooooo good.  We will absolutely, positively be back and hope Mike is our waiter then!",

       "text":"Ya know, for a chain restaurant, the steak at Bugaboo Creek is pretty darn good. In fact, it's the one chain restaurant that I really find myself craving on occassion. The decor is kinda kitsch-y, but the food is actually quite good. Serve has been kinda hit or miss every time i've been there- we've had some really great service, and some really poor service. There are 2 reasons that Bugaboo Creek gets 4 stars instead of 5. First, they're a chain, and I don't think that there's any Five Star chain restaurants out there. Secondly, their corporate offices do not make their nutritional information available, which I think is completely ridiculous. Any place that is standardized enough to be a chain should be standardized enough to have their nutritional information figured out. But going on the quality of the food alone, Bugaboo Creek is worth a visit.",

I came for a visit from Boston, MA on vacation and when I suddenly spotted Papi's, I immediately had to give it a try. I was impressed with the restaurant décor, service, and food menu. I had the shredded chicken, yellow rice, plantains, black beans and salad the first time. Delicious. The second time, I stopped in before heading back to the airport and just got the appetizer sampler that came with stuffed fried potato, ham croquettes, and a beef empanada. Delicious. I was not disappointed both times I went. I came with two friends and we were all completely satisfied! I will come here again if I have the opportunity to.",

       "text":"I really don't know what the hype is all about here. Sure, the ramen is a reasonable price. But it's not all that good. The noodles seem to be out of a package, and while the chicken broth is thick, it's not especially flavorful. The veggie broth is really, really thin and tasteless. The add-ins are a bit meager and the egg was completely hard boiled.\n\nI also took half of mine to go (I have a tiny stomach), and the broth\/meat\/noodle mixture turned into this thoroughly solid gelatinous chunk overnight. It was so icky that I just threw it out.\n\nThe add-ins are really basic, the tables aren't especially clean, and you're under a lot of pressure to eat quickly and get out. Also - a big pet peeve is that it's cash only, but it's not posted ANYWHERE. Not on the website, not on the menu, not on the walls; really, I scoured the place. It seemed almost like a cash only when I walked in, but I didn't ask when I sat down, partly because there's one server and they were rushing around but also because usually, it's posted somewhere!\n\nI really think that Boston could use a top notch ramen place that really takes the time to make their noodles right (or at least source them better). In the meantime, I'll stick with Totto.\n\nfwiw - I am spoiled by Momi Ramen in Miami and various ramen places in NY.",

       "text":"About a week ago, my friend and I spotted this place on our way home from dinner and decided that next week we give it a try. \nWe opted out of dessert over at Flemings to try the crepes here instead. Sorry to say, we were both VERY disappointed in this place and won't be coming back. \nI hate leaving a review like this, but I'd rather be honest about MY experience. First of all, I'm German and I know good crepes. When I walked in, we weren't even greeted with a friendly hello by the gentleman that worked there. He didn't have much of a personality and frankly, I thought he was a bit rude. \nI asked him if they served Cafe con leche and the guy actually had NO idea what that was. They have a huge cappuccino maker and other coffees to choose from, and he didn't even know what cafe con leche was??? \nWe both ordered the Nutella and Banana crepe. When I watched him make it, he literally \"drizzled\" a small amount of Nutella on the huge crepe and used an entire banana. Overkill on the banana and not enough Nutella at all! The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough...it didn't have much of a taste to it either. \nThere is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe, but guess what...they don't have ice cream. False advertising! If your going to have a picture of something on your menu, you better darn well serve it! \nWe both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had, but we are glad we came here too. Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes. Add more of the spreadable ingredients...and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout!!\nThey have it decorated nicely and it's very clean. The lady that made my cappuccino was friendly. I don't like giving reviews like this, but...that's what Yelp is for and maybe someone else will have a better experience than we did.",

       "text":"BE SURE TO READ ENTIRE POST!!!  For years, the guys at April Realty\/Aero Lawn Maintenance have occasionally mowed and trimmed my yard, a huge 7 acre mini-ranch in south Austin.  Even though they mow it infrequently, I'm always amazed that they remember from year to year all the little details. They do an excellent job, show up on time,  are friendly and courteous, and charge a fair price.  I can only afford to have them do it 3 or 4 times a year and I do the rest.   \n\nWhile they were mowing my yard a few weeks ago, a member of the crew accidentally hit my Toyota truck and put a fair-sized dent in the left front fender.  I didn't see him do it, and without an eyewitness I thought,  'Oh crap, this won't turn out well'. \n\nNervously, I called the owner, fearing that I might encounter the sort of denial and resistance we all run into all too often these days.  But what I got instead was what we all would like to find in such a situation: accountability.\n\nThe owner never hesitated to take responsibility.  His name is David, and I've met him a few times over the years.  And the way he handled what happened is the way every business owner should handle such situations.\n\nThe next day, I received a call from his insurance company, two days later an adjustor came out,  and within a week, I received a check for the damage.\n\nThat's how things are supposed to work.  That's called integrity, honesty, serving the customer.  And even though it's a little thing, it's the sort of thing that helps, even slightly, to restore your faith in people. And because it's become such a rare thing today, I wanted to point it out and say \"Thank You\".    \n\nFinally, we've gotten some rain and my grass is growing again.  In fact, I just noticed it's looking a little shaggy.  And thanks to David and the guys at April Realty, I know exactly who to call.",

Our 25-30 wound up being 50-55.\n\nWhat can I say that 500 other haven't said already? Not sure, but here's my 2 shiny pennies!\n\nPops & I are of Germanic heritage. He'd been hankering for a trip to Frankenmuth MI - while I would rather have a pencil stuck in my temple. I suggested we try a trip to the German Village in C-bus and he was game for it. While the wifey is not a huge fan of german food I assured her I'd make a suitable suggestion from the menu for her.\n\nFast forward - we're at our table (seating can be tight when busy) near the Autobahn buffet and looking over the menu - prices on everything BUT the buffet, which sort of gives me a bit of anxiety. I suggest babe order the weiner schnitzel (she likes a good tenderloin, schnitzel is the great grand father) while Pops decides a reuben is in order. Our server informs me the dinner Autobahn buffet is $15 which I leap at. (and their desserts are discouted if you order a buffet AND its $3 cheaper at lunch!!!!)\n\nSorry you guys have to wait, I'm already heading to the buffet!  Skip over the salad and straight to meat - brats, bahama mamas, mild bahama mamas, knockwurst, breaded baked chicken, warm german potato salad, red cabbage, mac n cheese and sauerkraut. Should have gotten 2 plates!\n\nI loved my Oma's cooking but I wish she'd had Schmidt's recipes - especially for the german potato salad. Best ever and I must recreate.\n\nSome say the bahama mamas are spicy. Nah. But if you love garlic, and I LOVE garlic, you must sample their knockwurst. Guaranteed to give you dragon breath tomorrow!!!! For me the standout sausage was truly the bratwurst. Absolutely friggin fantastic. And NO, I discovered a few days later ... you cannot order bratwursts delivered online. Ye Gods!\n\nPops loved his reuben and sweetie said she was very happy with the schnitzel. [duh]\n\nSo the brat was standout. But our takeaway was the vanilla cream puff. We had to have it packed to go - no way we could eat. We 3 split the next morning at our hotel - wishing we hadn't just gotten one. \n\nNot sure when I'll make it back but certainly will.",

I had the hardest time trying to find The Posh Spot from the garage. LOL! Make sure you turn at the QT, as if you're going into the apartment complex, THEN make a right into the plaza. You can park right in front of Posh Spot there. I listened to my GPS, which told me to make a right before I got to the QT, and... just... no. Don't do that. Make a right at the QT\/apartment complex. \n\nAnywho, did I say this place was awesome? IT IS. I had a gift certificate to come here, and I finally decided to use it on my week off from work. I absolutely love going to nice places on weekdays, because it's not all crowded and dirty. It was very quiet and peaceful. I had Ms. Stephanie, who was running a few minutes late, just like me. So, that was no big deal at all. She got started right away on my \"Perfectly Posh Signature Pedi\" with added Whipped Shea Masque- which lasted a tad bit over an hour. \n\nShe was very gentle and thorough, not rushy at all. I love how the chairs sit high and elevated above the floor. It's as if you're walking onto a throne of some sort to get your toes done. ;) One of my favorite parts was when Stephanie put some lemony smelling scrub? on my feet and then put them inside of a heating pocket for about 5-10 minutes or so. I'm sure that contributed to my feet feeling like a baby's bootay afterwards. The leg\/foot massage was awesome, as well. \n\nThe prices are not too shabby, a little bit above the regular ol nail salons, but it's worth it. Plus they offer so much more here! I'll definitely be coming back on my next off day! 2 weeks later and my color hasn't chipped yet- nice.",

I also told her that the color on my toes didn't math my fingers and she insisted it did. Once I got outside and seen it didn't and the mess left on my skin, I immediately went back and spoke to the owner. He became rude and told me he would fix two finger nails (at minimum five were a mess). He also said he didn't care about my toes. I made an appointment to come back the next morning. When I got there the first woman had an attitude and told me my toes were not her problem. Then she got up and told me she would not do anything. Then the women who initially messed up sat down to do my nails... Unacceptable! I had to argue with the owner to get my toes and fingers done correctly. I was not mad at the initially employee, I just didn't want her to mess up again and I would've continued to go if I was handled appropriately. Although the two former women that did my nails kept me coming back, I refuse to give them anymore of my money ($65 biweekly) due to their customer service.

Large portions (huge dumplings) that were flavorful and hot (not just in temperature). The menu is fairly standard in its Chinese fare, but there are some interesting surprises such as Szechuan Spicy Noodle with Pork. \n\nI'm not kidding when I say the portions are HUGE in both the appetizers and entrees. The waiter recommended ordering a combination platter for a smaller portion with a choice of rice. The standard entrees don't come with complementary rice. Despite this, one would probably want to avoid the additional carbs as a side dish to the heaping amount of sodium that comes with every order. \n\nOverall, a great restaurant in terms of food and service.

We were only a small steps away from the ending, so they allow us to finish it after time was up!!",

Are there any volunteers to fly out tomorrow?\"\n\nOur schedules were clear and they were offering the night's lodging and dinner money, plus 2 free airline tickets. You bet we said \"yes.\" So now we're in the airport and want to choose the best restaurant there. We find just what we're looking for in Terminal B before you have to go through security.\n\nThe Legal C Bar run by Legal Seafoods.\n\nLook: Most airport restaurants suck. That's the way the world mostly works these days. But not the Legal C Bar. It's serves legitimate 4 star seafood and couldn't have been a better find. It's simply the best airport food I've found, literally in the entire world (not counting the airport hotel restaurants you'll find in  places like Singapore, etc.). \n\nSo I'm asking' ya, please tell me if you know of some place better, 'cause I want to nominate these guys for some kind of award or something, given the miserable nature of most airport eats.",

The grounds hosted stunning views of the tree line and the city with several walking paths to wonder thru. The inside was well cared for and curated to show a traditional upper class home for the time. Wonderful furnishings and fixtures were set up with great informative and descriptive signs to enjoy. Most of the home is furnished in a way to reflect opulence and wealth but not really how the original family lived there. Most furnishings were far more glam than the pictures of the original rooms which is explained in several areas but I would have liked to see more of the original items or replications of them at least. A great way to spend the morning and an even better way to get amazing pictures of the city and views.",

The meat options were Salisbury steak, ribs, fried chicken, baked chicken, and more.  The side options were the classic southern fare. Collard greens, fried okra, mac and cheese, corn bread, etc. \n\nThe price was also pretty good. Only 9.50 for a huge serving of ribs, mac and cheese, and fried okra.

       "text":"Very disappointed and at some points had thoughts of \"is this really happening right now?\". I bought a groupon for a full set of eyelash extensions with 1 fill. I go to my appointment for the full set of lash extensions. I'm right on time for my appointment and I walk up to the glass door, which is locked, but I see the woman (who I assume is going to do my lashes because she's the only one in the small room) and she is on her cell phone. She notices me when I walk up to the glass door by looking in the mirror and seeing my reflection. She continues to talk on her phone and hasn't turned around yet to face me. I knock and she still doesn't run around, but I know she's already seen me through the mirror she's staring into. I was thinking \"what's going on here??\" Then after about 20 seconds of me staring at her and her back turned toward me, she finally turns around and points to the chair sitting outside the glass door and when I look down I see that it has papers to fill out for first time customers. I sat down in the chair (mind you she's still on the phone and hasn't unlocked the glass door) and fill out the paper, probably taking about 2 minutes to fill out. I stand up and face the glass door and she's still on the phone, I'm standing there laughing at this point because I can't believe this is going on. Then I had to pee, so I just walked away from the glass door and went to the bathroom (this place is set up inside a building with other clinics\/salons). I go to the bathroom, walk back to he glass door and she's now what it looks like saying goodbye on the phone and then unlocks the door to let me in and says \"sorry\". I was so mad, but didn't say anything and went on with the lash appointment. I've gotten lashes done before so I knew what to expect. Basically the outcome was mediocre (I wanted monger and told her, but they were average length) and my left eye was red and hurting for 2 days afterwards which has never happened before with pervious lash extensions from other places. I will never go back there again and seriously that woman was so rude to be on her phone ignoring me for so long when I got there ( for probably 20 minutes total)",

       "text":"Let me begin by saying that I don't like German food. I hate sauerkraut and bratwurst and all that stuff. It's too heavy and it's not my thing. So I really wasn't expecting to like Schmidt's and was very pleasantly surprised when I did.\n\nIt's tucking away in German village. I'd never actually seen the place before because I don't venture around those parts much. But we were going here with the purpose of trying it out because I've heard so many good things. I wanted to be adventurous. \n\nThe place was very busy. It was around 7 on a Thursday night. But I liked the atmosphere. Very German, but not overbearingly so. There were some men in liederhosen and they were the band that was playing German music. They did a few requests and popular songs German style. The Simpsons and Family Theme songs come to mind.\n\nWe couldn't come here and not try some of the beers. Some of what they have is from the Elevator's Brewery. I had the Hefeweizen all night. I was disappointed to find that they didn't have any sort of happy hour, but oh well. The beer was excellent and served with a lemon wedge on the glass.\n\nWe decided to try the Schmidt's Famous Pretzel Nuggets as an appetizer. But - our server forgot to put the order in and we didn't get them until after we already had our food. That kinda sucked. But they were delicious - they were fried, but no batter so they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sweet honey mustard dipping sauce was addicting.\n\nI wasn't too sure what to order since I don't like German and just about everything on the menu was bratwurst and stuff like that. So I went with the Bahama Burger Special. The \"Bahama Mama\" is what this place is famous for. It's their specialty brat that's spicy. I wanted to try it, but wasn't sure. This dish comes with it in the form of a burger, so the cut is like a patty and there's no casing, which sounded good to me. It also came on a pretzel bun with tomato, onion and lettuce and swiss cheese. And guess what? I loved it. It was amazing. Not as spicy as I hoped, but I really liked it. I got the potato pancakes with applesauce as my side. They were good, little round cakes that were good dipped in the chunky applesauce. Yummy, but not all that great.\n\nJeff got the Bahama Mama platter, which came with cole slaw, potato salad, and was a huge brat on top of sauerkraut. It also came with a big toasted bun. He loved it.\n\nFor dessert we knew we had to get cream puffs. They are huge and look delicious - there is a display case filled with them right when you walk in the door. A clever marketing strategy if I ever saw one. It works. We were planning to share one but couldn't agree on one. So we got two, which ended up being insane because there was no way we could eat it all. He ate about half of his and I only managed about 5 or 6 bites of mine. Jeff got the chocolate one. It was a light fluffy sauce that wasn't at all too much chocolate. It was topped with powdered sugar and chocolate drizzle. I got the special buckeye one that was filled with light peanut butter cream and topped with this fudgy chocolate and nuts. Wonderful. I'm not a huge cream puff fan, but these were great.\n\nOur server was nice. He gave us one of our cream puffs half off because of the appetizer trouble. I wish we just gave us the pretzels for free, though. At $5.25 per puff, we didn't get much of a discount. And our bill was crazy! About $70 for all this food and beer. I guess it wasn't awful, but still. I wish this place was cheaper, but I did have enough left over for another meal. Jeff didn't, though.\n\nI will come back for sure, but I'll know that it can get pricey. But I was really impressed with how much I liked it despite my dislike for German foods. It won me over, but the appetizer service and prices knock one star off.",

       "text":"I'm pretty new to this gym, but I'm writing this review because I think it really needs to be on the map.\n\nAlthough I'm far from an elite athlete, I've found Crossfit to be an incredibly effective way to improve my fitness and confidence in the past. It's not easy, it's not cheap, and it's not for everyone--but taught effectively, it gives a person tools for improving and measuring physical function across many domains.\n\nBefore moving to Atlanta, I worked out at a Crossfit gym with coaches who'd had years of experience in coaching various athletics, and who also had a background in physical therapy and\/or exercise science. They knew how to teach people to do the movements safely, and how to motivate people to work hard, even when it hurts. This made them outstanding coaches not just for elite athletes, but also for people like me. My experience at that gym was life-changing.\n\nI'd had trouble finding the same level of knowledge and skill at a Crossfit gym in Atlanta, until now. The two coaches--one male, one female--who run this gym have many years of experience coaching both Crossfit and other sports. Combined, they also have academic background and higher levels of certification that come across in the way they're able to figure out what I'm doing wrong with a certain movement, or how to improve mobility in a certain joint. The programming is created by the coaches, who are consistently attentive and helpful.\n\nBecause the place is new, classes are currently small.  On any given day, I work out with people about at my level or less experienced, and with people who could bench-press me with one hand. Parking behind the gym is plentiful. Most patrons are friendly, although one of the owners was downright crusty to me on my first day here, which was a minor downer. I got over it, because the coaching is great, but others might not be so tolerant. I would love if it were easier to put my membership on hold when I travel, and am holding out hope that becomes an option somewhere down the road.\n\nRegardless of some of these bumps, I think this place has what it takes to be an incredible resource to a lot of people at different levels of fitness, and I'm delighted it's in the neighborhood.",

       "text":"I ate at Tavern in the Square for the second time yesterday. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar.  At first the bartenders seemed like they would be attentive, but that was not the case. We ordered lunch and drinks. These were served to us, but once our drinks were empty they never offered another drink.  I watched one bartender walk by 5 times and look at our empty drinks, but never once did he ask if we wanted anything else.  My boyfriend had to ask for our check instead of it being offered to us. Honestly we would have had a second drink, but were never offered one and should not have to ask especially when the bar was not crowded at all. The food was actually really good. I had the classic macaroni & cheese, and my boyfriend had the candied bacon and bleu cheese burger.  This is the only reason I gave two stars. It's a shame that the service was so bad cause we typically spend a lot out at restaurants and return to places with good service. Next time we're in the area we will try another place.",

       "text":"Schmidt's.  Ah, Schmidt's.  What can I say about Schmidt's?  It's a Columbus institution, along with Thurman's, Katzinger's and the North Market.  Is this vaunted, beloved status deserved?  Absolutely.  Not for being fancy (it isn't), not for being revolutionary or innovative (it's neither), but for being Schmidt's and being it a LOT, and very well.\n\nSchmidt's will give you authentic, German comfort food, as much of it as you can stand.  They will give it to you in the quaint, brick-lined dining room that probably has not changed or been updated in 30 years, and thank goodness for that.\n\nI rarely order off the menu because I prefer to eat off the buffet, which is available almost all the time (I think) and comes with a discounted dessert.  You can get chunks of their delicious signature sausages and other German favorites like German potato salad (which tastes exactly like what my great-grandmother used to make, so comforting), red cabbage (so delicious) and more American comfort food choices like mac and cheese and meatloaf.  For more traditional German dishes like sauerbraten and wienerschnitzel, you'll need to order off the menu.\n\nNow, one of Schmidt's most famous items are their cream puffs.  I admit that I am not a fan, but that isn't their fault.  I just don't like cream puffs, in general.  Theirs are, I admit, very impressive.  Huge and sweet, with pastry light as a feather.  \n\nGoing to Schmidt's with family or friends is just one of those feel-good, dependable outings that makes you feel like Columbus is your town, and this is one of your places.  You never know, you might discover a couple of old guys in lederhosen playing polkas in the dining room.",

It's one thing to wait for service in a busy place, but LTK just wasn't busy at 3:30 pm on Tuesday 6\/18\/13.   I was promptly seated and it was a reasonable wait between placing my order and the food's arrival.  For everything else I waited too long -  too long to be greeted by the server,  too long to have my order taken, too long for a check back after food was served, and too long for the check.   About  half the seats were occupied and there appeared to be ample waitstaff on duty and not busy, as evidenced by the several servers milling about at the back.  Luckily I had plenty of time before my flight.   At any price point, a diner deserves good service. At Legal prices, I expect more.  Won't be back.",

This store cares about its customers; I took the easy way out and called a 1-800 number, got frustrated, and immediately posted a one-star review (another lesson... wait a few days before posting a review).  The store manager went out of her way to talk to me and resolve the problem.  As mentioned before, the service and quality at Wolf are great... and their customer service is impeccable.",

I was rung up for 70 instead of the 60 I was told I would be charged. They had already started cleaning my car and I explained this to the manager - that I wouldn't have chosen the package that was 70 and that he could ask the attendant with whom I spoke to verify that I was given the incorrect price. The manager was a jerk and said pretty much \"too bad\". Keep in mind I was very polite when I spoke to him. I think it was an honest mistake on the part of the attendant but the manager should have checked with him. and didnt. \nTHEN it took three days for my carpet to dry. This was a huge problem because I was traveling the next day which is why I wanted my van cleaned. I was told it would only take one day to dry which seemed reasonable. It was awful packing everything on wet carpet! I lined the floors with plastic bags to keep things dry. what a huge pain in the butt. I had a van load of stuff because I was helping my son move to a different state. We were traveling and had to bring everything inside each night along the way so that the carpet would dry at night.

Seems like that's a time of year they should provide timing given that it's likely a gift for someone.  Quality is good, staff is questionable at best.",

       "text":"Pittock Mansion...oh your garden...oh your views...oh the drive up. So beautiful! \n\nWe purchased a Groupon to see this immensely beautiful historic mansion and it was worth it. We spent at least 40 minutes just sitting outside in the garden area taking in the beautiful views Portland has to offer and taking pictures so that we could remember them later. \n\nI've been to many historical mansions in my day but none has been filled with so many restored rooms as this one! The only room that really creeped me out was the kiddies room. It has all these old dolls just perfectly lined up and looking at you. Jesus, it reminded me of Amityville Horror or something. The other portion I did not care for was the basement art room. Though, it did include excerpts on how the mansion came to be and how it was restored after the residents of Portland put together enough money to buy the house. \n\nI would have given anything to have lived in this house. Apart from the fact that it gave you a sense of peace and comfort, I just can't get over the freaking views!!!",

I was excited to see that there would be a new \"bar\" type place because living in the suburbs there isn't much! \nA group of us wanted to go for dinner and drinks. The rule is that you have to have at LEAST 6 people to make reservations otherwise it's first come, first serve -- and on a Friday or Saturday night that means hours. \nTheir drinks are large and the cocktails are yummy but they are quite pricey.\nThe margaritas are very good and I've had the mango crush - also delicious!\nThe food is good, portions are large - enough for 2 people. \nParking is terrible....even to get TO the parking lot is confusing. \nI do reccomend but I'd go only for a splurge or special occasion.",

It was still packed with people when I went and that says a lot considering it was about 2PM on a Saturday.  \n\nThe food is actually pretty good for a buffet and definitely met my expectations.  There is really a lot of variety available here with plenty of good fruit, salad and dessert options in addition to the sushi, stir fry station and hot foods.\n\nI have tried both of their locations.  Both this one and their Revere location.  This one seems to slightly edge out the other location for food quality and tastiness.  \n \nOne thing about this location is that it is a little distance from a major highway.  So probably upwards of 20 mins from any major highway exit.  Not that convenient for out of town visitors but very good for locals though.\n\nDo give this place a try.  For the price, you can't go wrong.",

       "text":"An awesome little place, in a really nice part of Germantown, with awesome food.  My family and I went here for lunch, with tasty results.  Portions are large and hearty-- I had the buffet, which is a great value for the money if you love German Sausages.  When you get the buffet, you also get a discount when you purchase one of their delicious desserts.  \n\nMy family ordered the hot pretzel nuggets, which are fried, delicious, and tasty, especially with the honey mustard sauce they serve it with.  Generous portions, and not oily at all.  The original sausage sandwich was huge, more than enough for my sister and mom, and was served with a hearty portion of spatzle. \n\nThe buffet saw a number of side dishes, including green beans, cabbage, bean and ham soup, mac and cheese, red cabbage, German potato salad, sauerkraut, and several salad items, including applesauce, a green salad, and bread rolls.  While the sausage stew tasted a little strange, it wasn't too bad, and the buffet had 5 different types of sausage.  Everything was freshly stocked and tasted great.  Note that when you pick up a buffet, you can buy a dessert (normally $4-$5) for $2.50.  \n\nFor dessert, the four of us split two cream puffs-- one chocolate, one vanilla.  These were GREAT.  The cream was rich and soft, and there was definitely no cutting back on the good stuff!\n\nTo top off the whole affair, service was terrific.  Parking is easy, and it's definitely a memorable experience.",

Barely edible.  \n\nThe service was slow and uninterested, actually sitting down at a table near us to text for 10 minutes, but he does get credit for noticing we barely touched the masitas, and he comped it.\n\nI'd like to give Papi's another shot.

While I was there on Sunday, there were a few people walking in, hoping to do their nails. In the end, the owner managed to get a staff in to help.

One side of the nail was coming off and she said she would add powder (?) to seal it or something. The end result was a smooth nail and it took the polish nicely. \n\nAs with most nail places now, there are massage chairs with the foot bath attached, and a common TV to entertain you.

It's also a good late-night place (open 'til 3AM) when you're craving something other than what's available at Waffle House or Landmark Diner.\n\nNote that there are two menus. While they have many dishes in common, non-Asians are usually given the one with a selection that is supposedly geared more to Western palates whereas the other is typically given to Asians; this is the one that includes \"down home\" dishes that many non-Asians may find, well, unappetizing. I often order from both, whether I'm eating there or taking out. \n\nCongee is quite the comfort food for me but I'm not big on the version here because they add ginger.

(Seattle was perfect. ) today my wife and I stopped in and ordered the veggie burger and some sides.  After paying, they told me that there was only one veggie burger left, which obviously became my wife's.  After going through the line again to figure out what I wanted I ordered a veggie sandwich and a tofu skewer - and had to pay an extra 2 dollars.  I don't usually need something for free, but at this point my family was waiting at the table wondering where I was - maybe just comping me the difference at this point would have been appropriate? The veggie sandwich was thin, filled with dry wilty field greens and julienned carrots. No slices of avocado, and the bread was basic orowheat. The tofu was very dry and underwhelming compared to the skewer in Seattle (which was awesome.) About 6 off duty employees hung at a table and gossiped and sang to music, which was fine but maybe there could be another employee at another register to expedite things?\n\nThe whole thing was mediocre. Veggie food and service in this town can't be mediocre. There are too many options.  - And you just can't run out of veggie burgers. - Mike.",

My experience at Toscana prompted me to finally share!\n\nI walked into Toscana Saturday morning and asked if they could do a pedicure.  They pleasantly assured me that they could, asked if I wanted coffee, etc.\n\nThis salon is not equipped to do pedicures.  The pedicure chairs are actually chairs that belong by pool - really, I mean it, they are lawn furniture.  While they do fit the kitschy Tuscan theme, you cannot sit all the way back in the chair and extend your leg across the pedicure basin without feeling like you are at the gym doing leg extensions.  \n\nAnd the pedicure basin - also very pretty but my size 7.5 narrow, feet barely fit into the basin, which is actually just a fancy, bathroom sink mounted to the ground.  \n\nWhoever designed the spa had a great vision but poor execution.  I was willing to look beyond all of this though (particularly since the very sweet, apologetic nail tech pulled a waiting area chair over for me to shift to which was more comfortable) until I  heard they had no nail dryer or quick dry spray.  \n\nWhile the nail tech apologized profusely (despite it obviously not being her fault), the receptionist immediately got an attitude with me.  She informed me that they were a day spa and I was there to relax so I should just wait there for five minutes and let my nails dry.  This was followed by a variety of other attitudimous execuses such as (A) \"We don't really specialize in pedicures\" and (B) \"We don't use nail dryers or spray...most spas don't.\"  \n\nAgain, the nail tech who did my pedicure was sweet and did a pretty good job.  However, this salon is new and it seems like they are still getting their act together.  If a salon is not properly equipped to provide a service, then tell your clients that rather than lying and doing a poor job.\n\nThe nail tech actually brought a hair dryer downstairs and dried my toes with it.  Still, my toe nails were smudged by the time I got home, and I fortunately had the same color polish at home and painted over them.  \n\nP.s. Their coffee sucks.",

First off, it was not as large as it once was but also the bread was not as good. For that it loses a star. \n\nOk here's my 2 cents. The thursday special (pork plate) with garbanzo beans is stellar. The beans can be salty some days and one time I had to remove a bay leaf from my bowl. Good thing I recognized and and did not bite in! Regardless, the beans (black too) are delicious. I enjoy the fried plantains and almost always have to get them if i do not have some on my plate. One day, when I was insanely hungry, I ordered this tasty meat stuffed potato pastry thing in addition to my meal and did not regret it. \n\nI hope to go in the near future and if the quality is back to the old times, I will post a re-rating",

       "text":"TACKY AMBIANCE - POOR FOOD - POOR SERVICE\n\nAlthough all 17 reviews thus far have been very positive (no 3-star, 2-star, or 1-star reviews), my GF and I had a poor experience which I relate below.\n\n1. AMBIANCE - 2 STARS - Ernie's isn't at all quaint or charming. It has tacky things on the walls, and it's dark, depressing, and exceedingly cramped. It seats only 20 people, comprised of 12 people seated at tables and 8 people seated at the very tight counter.\n\nIn the table area, all of the tables are only 24 inches square, which provides far too little room to put food. There are only 3 tables for 2 people, and 3 tables abutting each other to seat a party of 6 people. Honestly, it's really much more of a place to get food to go, not a good place to sit and dine.\n\nIndeed, this area is very uncomfortable, especially when other people come in just too order lunch to go. When this occurs, the commotion disturbs the peace of all the 12 seated patrons.\n\nAt the counter, the passageway behind the rotating stools is so narrow that you have to squeeze by sideways if you need to use the restroom.\n\n2. OVERALL FOOD QUALITY - 2 STARS - I ate a Corned Beef Hash Omelet, Home Fries, and buttered Wheat Toast.\n\nHASH OMELET - 1 STAR - The egg that enveloped the Hash tasted good, but the Hash itself tasted horrible and was inedible.\n\nPam, the Waitress\/Owner, freely admitted that the Hash wasn't home-made, and I strongly suspect it came directly from a can, very similar to something made by Hormel. After just one bite, I scraped it away and ate nothing but the egg.\n\nHOME FRIES - 2.5 STARS - Soft and tasteless.\n\nThe potatoes had been diced small, cooked soft inside and out (I'd have preferred a crispy outside) , but were almost tasteless. They had obviously been fried in tasteless Wesson Oil instead of a tasty oil such as bacon fat, no seasoning had been applied to the exterior, and no tasty additions like onions had been included.\n\nWHEAT TOAST - 3.5 STARS - Standard fare bread. Nothing fancy or whole grain.\n\n3. WAITRESS SERVICE - 2 STARS - Pam is definitely a nice woman with a nice personality, and I know she means well. However, her level of service needs to improve.\n\nPam placed my GF's pancake on my side of the cramped table, instead of on my GF's side. I believe that Pam did this because it was a convenient open spot. However, Pam could have easily spent a few seconds to rearrange the table slightly to make room for my GF's pancake on her own side. Instead, she left this task to us, which is more like a disservice than a service.\n\nAlso, when Pam brought us our first glasses of water, they came with ice. That was good. However, when Pam brought us our second glasses of water, they came with no ice. Instead, she asked us if we wanted ice by saying, \"you don't need ice, do ya?\" which was anything but the right thing to say or do.",

However, by the time we were mid way through our meal, service was getting better, food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the dishes were good.\n\nWe ordered XLB and each one was placed on top of a thinly sliced carrot to prevent sticking.  Not the best XLB I've ever eaten, but it wasn't bad.  The pan fried noodles were piping hot and had enough meat and veggies as well as sauce.  The green onion pancake were crispy and light with tons of green onions.  \n\nNote - they do not accept reservations unless you have 8 or more people.",

Despite the crowd, the service was expedient and warm. \n\nThe beers here speak for themselves, so we sampled some of their taproom only offerings, and the galaxy smash was clean, tropical and sessionable.\n\nThis being said, the real star of this place is the pizza. It's a hand tossed style crust, that's the perfect mix of crispy and doughy. We ordered the special pizza (luau- bacon, pineapple and fresh jalapeño), and it was the perfect mix of fat, sweetness and heat. \n\nIf you're looking for a comfortable spot to grab a beer, and share some food with some friends on pearl, this is the place!",

This is probably the 2nd bowl of ramen I almost finished to completion.\n\nThe wait was almost an hour--the place is cash only and very popular (there was a line, the place seats probably no more than 20 folks)--so have something to entertain you or have a friend to save your spot in line while you peruse other places in the building (like the cute Japanese store next door, and the other places in the food court).\n\nWill try Tan-Tan Men or the House Ramen, plus the pork bun or chicken karaage next time.

The only drawback this trip was coming home after a ten hour day at Epcot, and our key not being active any longer. I was riding with my boyfriend, so I left my ID in the room. When I went to the front desk, I was asked for ID, then chided for driving without my license. When I noted I simply drove from behind the check in area at my room's parking lot, he turned up his lip. When I asked why my key deactivated, he said probably because the person who checked me in did so for only\n2 days, and not 3 days as I paid for (he was the one who checked me in). The floors made my feet dirty (either the carpet or the tiles, not sure which). They ran out of washcloths after taking ours earlier in the day. My son's pillow case kept getting removed from his pillow, the pillow we brought from home. The cleaning staff kept putting their pillow case on his pillow.

Who knows :( the ambience there is very nice definitely has that great vibe that feels like the potentials there but my waitress didn't bother to ask me if I liked my food she just took my order the food was dropped off and then the check was just brought over she didn't even ask if I wanted desert so customer service definitely was not spot on either..",

Which brings me to my 2 star rating, simply because their garlic parm wings are so amazing... if it weren't for those I wouldn't go to wingstop anymore. Being that I work and live near a wingstop I have given them more chances then I should have. In the last 2-3 months I have ordered wingstop maybe 10 times most of time being a different location. The other location never, and I mean never got our order correct. So I tried this location thinking it would be better. 3 out of 4 orders were wrong. Everytime it's always something different. Wrong flavors, wrong type of wings, or a mixture of the two, missing fries, missing ranch, etc. I've seen it all and I order the same thing everytime as you may already noticed garlic parm and lemon pepper bone in wings, 8-12pcs depends.... how do you mix that up with a 20 pcs boneless bbq. I have officially given up on wingstop after I went there during the holidays and I \"had\" to purchase a drink with my wings. Okay fine, take my cups that I did not want and go to get my fountain drink. Surprise the fountain machine is already been \"broken\" done, but I didn't see that before placing my cup under the machine. I was instantly sprayed with soda.... so I went back to the register and asked for my money back for the drinks that I didn't want in the first place now that I have been soaked by their machine that was taken apart during business hours and they refused. Even went as far as putting the machine back together just so I could fill my unwanted drinks..... with that I will never return to this wingstop or any other one again, I'll miss you garlic parm wings :(",

The menu is large and I doubt you'd dislike anything you might order, but talk of it being \"the best Chinese food in Columbus\" makes me feel sort of cheated every time I go there.  I expect miracles, but the food here is definitely of an earthly variety.  That said, Hunan Lion is enjoyable and definitely suitable for a more \"upscale\" occasion or clientele.  The atmosphere is a notch above usual \"Chinese restaurant\" style, the restaurant can accomodate large groups, there is a full bar and large menu of tropical drinks, and the service is good - but my loyalties lie elsewhere.  3.5 stars.",

You feel more like you're in someone's home than in a restaurant. The staff was very accommodating and super friendly. When we sat down, our waitress (the owner?) told us that the menu was more of a guide and that we could have any combination of anything on the menu. Want an extra pancake? No problem. A half portion of French toast for a side? Can do. All of the sweets were homemade, including fresh blueberry and snicker doodle muffins baked that same morning. I really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. The decor was dated, but that just added to the experience. Service was prompt, but we never felt rushed or in the way. Many regulars came in while we sat there and even though we were new, it felt like a big family. I'll definitely be going back soon. Prices are very reasonable, but CASH ONLY.",

Parking could be slightly annoying as with all Atlanta locations, there's free parking around the back of restaurant as well as street parking. It's definitely a tight space so I wouldn't bring a large group here! \n\nMy personal favorite is the Cuban Sandwich, which is a hefty amount of food thats tasteful and definitely not dry. It's definitely a great bargain for the amount of food you get. Any serving of beef or pork dishes are assured to not disappoint. They are tasteful and not tough. After going to a few good restaurants in Miami (though arguable if they are truly Cuban), this is definitely pretty good for being local! Food is good enough for a 4 rating, however...\n\nService is probably it's largest issue. Even during off hours (3PM?), the service was pretty slow. Obviously this is frustrating if one is trying to go in for a quick meal and leave. Given this as well as the tight space, probably not the best for groups. There weren't many people around and it's clear that a lot of the servers were on break or managing other parts of the restaurant. \n\nBoth Papi's in this location as well as the one in Emory Point are quite similar! A few of my friends noted that the Emory Point location may be less consistent than this one is.",

       "text":"This was our first visit to Tavern in the Square in Burlington, MA and we are excited to say we were completely satisfied. There were 3 adults in our group. The server, Michael, was perfect and should be a trainer for servers in other restaurants. He was informative, funny, paid us the right amount of attention and we really appreciated his service. We were able to sample one of the local microbrews (Queen City Brewery, Burlington, VT. -  South End Lager) and found it crisp and delicious. It is a light, blond lager that accentuates the German malt. Mildly hoppy, it was terrific and is highly recommended.\nThe Sweet Potato Poutine appetizer is a killer combo. The sweet potato fries, duck confit and cheese curds make for an awesome combination. I swear the duck is quickly kissed by the fryolator to provide a light, crispy texture that compliments the rest of the duck meat. If you're in the mood for a few beers and an appetizer, this is the one.\nWe had the Tavern Burger with lettuce, tomato and mayo. They forgot the mayo but this was quickly remedied with a small ramekin delivered to the table. The angus burger was cooked perfectly to order and the roll was excellent. The fries are very good and make the perfect accompaniment. \nThe Old School Cuban sandwich was excellent. The combination of the pulled pork, ham and pickles was on point. The ciabatta roll was soft and ideal for this sandwich. This diner chose the onion ring side dish and was not disappointed. The fry cook knows what he\/she is doing as these were rings of gold. The batter was cooked to perfection, (OK, the way we like it) close to tan and not a hint of overdone.\nThe third diner ordered the Chicken, Bacon and Waffles dinner. This southern style meal was impressively presented with all items stacked and skewered on a foundation of real mashed potatoes. Once deconstructed, each component was sampled and we could not decide what we liked better. The chicken was fried all the way to heaven with an awesome coating, the buttermilk waffles were crispy, the bacon and potatoes were exactly what was hoped for: crispy on the bacon, and smoothly whipped potatoes with hints of the skin mixed in. \n\nPortion sizes on all meals would not disappoint even the hungriest of diners.\n\nThough we shouldn't have, we decided to share one dessert. We chose the Bruleed Pound Cake. They start by loading the bowl with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. On top of that is a mysterious and delicious concoction of pieces of pound cake and creme brulee including pieces of crispy caramelized sugar. They top this amazing dessert with a heaping amount of fresh whipped cream. This was perfectly sized for three people. \n\nWe will definitely return and look forward to sampling some of the other offerings.",

       "text":"Airport food gets a bad rap (most of the time, rightfully so).  The environment of most airports, combined with the hassle of travel, sucks the fun out of most dining experiences.\n\nI'm happy to report that this is NOT the case with Legal Seafoods in the C concourse of Boston Logan.  I've eaten here on several occasions as I'm passing through Boston and actually look forward to the experience.\n\nI typically get a cup of the clam chowder and the salad with grilled shrimp.  Tasty stuff!  The chowder is creamy and delicious and the shrimp are flavorful.  \n\nSince the dining area is not enclosed, you don't feel particularly cramped, and it's a good venue for people watching, especially if you take a seat at the stools overlooking the main foot traffic.\n\nNeedless to say, this place is pretty popular and, as a result, can get crowded.  You may need to wait for a table, which isn't always possible given your flight schedule.  If you have a layover or get to the airport early, and want to avoid below-average airport grub, make a bee-line to Legal.",

We ordered the ginger beef which had celery and carrots. This was delicious. The beef was crispy and the veggies were cooked perfectly. On recommendation, we also ordered the sweet and sour cod - this was huge! Everyone really enjoyed this fish. We also ordered the sweet pea shoots which was a nice equalizer between also the rich flavors. This is my first time eating authentic Chinese food and you can automatically tell because the menu items aren't the \"traditional\" ones you see in America. The servers happened to be sister - both very nice. A lot of regulars seem to come in later in the evening. No doubt a great restaurant!",

The prices are also fair and I love the feel of the store and the ambiance. Some students of mine introduced me to this a couple years ago when they hosted an event for the store in their old space and now I'm hooked. I'm so sad to see vintage stores close down and hope people will shop here.

       "text":"Pluses: Fast delivery, Late night hours, FRESH and healthy produce\/ ingredients!  New business in town with lots of potential; answers a real need for this neighborhood.  Love that there is a multi grain crust option.\n\nMinuses: Soft wonder-bread-ish crust, extremely bland sauce, odd unmelted cheese.  I couldnt eat more than one piece, even after putting my own spices and salt -- it just tasted like a chicken sandwich with spaghetti sauce and soft wheat bread.\n\nMy advice: (I know im no business person, but i do eat a lot of pizza) put less riser in the crust (less baking soda or yeast?) so its not so cakey, make sure the crust comes out browned, not white and make sure the dough is actually cooked through in the center; Use REAL CHEESE -- the menu says fresh mozzarella, but it doesnt melt like it is real mozarella; Instead of using spaghetti sauce on the pizza (its too bland) use a super garlic and spicy italian sauce.  To see what I mean try out any of the red sauces at Daves Fresh Pasta just a few blocks away in Davis Square.  Those sauces could be pizza sauces, they are super spiced and flavorful, thats what will please your customers in this hood, thats my guess.\n\nEven though this first try didnt work out for me, I'll be checking back again and trying pizza pie-er, because they are finding their target customers.  This is a new business and they deserve the benefit of the doubt, especially when they are doing a late night pizza option with healthy ingredients -- which I am thankful for ,and really could take off in this neighborhood!   Good luck Pizza pie-er im rooting for you and will up my review if possible in the future.",

The store is very clean and organized and the employees and cashiers are always so friendly and pleasant.   \n\nMake sure to check your receipts because on the last couple of visits I've been getting coupons to use on future visits towards grocery items, the Starbucks at the front of the store in addition other items. \n\nAnd bring your recyclable bags to get 5 cents off your total.",

Our drink order was taken promptly, one coke and one beer, and we didn't see our server again for 10 minutes.  I believe it was the bartender who finally brought the beer, but didn't get the coke. He then brought our second drink a few minutes later.  When we did see our server, she was  taking an order at another table, and then 5 minutes later brought those people their drinks.  Didn't see her again for another 5 minutes when she finally came back to take our order.  At that point we were more than 20 minutes into this place, and decided it wasn't worth any more waiting so we put a few bucks down and got up and left.  Very poor service.

The place was busy but still enjoyable and the service was relatively quick. \n\nThe menu offers varied Thai dishes with the usual classics (pad Thai, curries) but also regional Thai dishes which are less common but definitely worth trying. The portions were just about right leaving you satisfied but not bloated. \n\nThe only negative aspect was the very light decor. The logo and street sign is very colourful but the inside of the restaurant is not cosy, rather dull and white with a few minor pieces of art on the walls.

My friend and my boyfriend didn't feel like cooking one night, so we decided on take-out.\nMy friend loves Cuban food so we decided to try this place out.\n\nLet me tell you first, this is definitely a hole in the wall type of places. But mom-pops\/hole in the wall places are where you get one of the best experiences\/foods. There's a downstairs with a lot of seating areas and an upstairs to pick up to-go orders. The man upstairs in charge of the take out orders wasn't the nicest man on the planet. But it'll do.\n\nWe ordered so much food. We ordered two main entrees along with plantains and small appetizers and a cuban sandwich that came up for about $60. But the food... it was absolutely delicious. The main entrees comes with the choice of meat, rice, and salad. They are very generous with their portions. And they have this spicy sauce. ASK FOR THE SPICY SAUCE, whether you like spicy or not. It adds more flavor and so good. \nI love how they make their rice... It's just so good to eat with the meat. \n\nParking here may or may not be difficult. They have their own private parking lot in the back, but there are not many spots. And there is also street parking.",

Even with the weird customer service at the end, I'm giving it a 4 stars, for all the positives and benefits!\n\nWe love the set up of the villa especially with it being for 4 adults - Me, my hubby, my mom, and dad! We didn't have to be stuck in one hotel room. We had perfect space where we didn't have to be on top of each other. We had a downstairs open living room, dining area, small kitchen, and a bathroom with shower downstairs. The couch  even has a bed in it if one needs it.\n\nUpstairs is two bedrooms and an adjoining bathroom with bath tub. One bedroom had two double beds and one bedroom has a king sized bed. The beds were very comfy, the sheets and comforter were cozy. Only thing was the pillows were very small.\n\nWe had a view of the creek which was nice and nature-y! The pool was nice along with two small hot tubs which were not hot. They have a park and big grassy area for our dog to play. We were not able to walk the boardwalk and gazebo which looked really nice.\n\nAt the end, customer service was weird because the person I called to extend my check out an hour didn't know we existed. He said it was because Booking.com and their system did not communicate. Also, I asked for two towels and they brought us two rolls of toilet paper. I was like What?! At least our receipt matched our quote from Booking.com. \n\nAll in all, we loved our clean roomy villa and would recommend staying here.",

       "text":"Where to start?  This is my first time writing a Yelp review, but I had such a terrible experience with Budget I felt compelled to write.  I thought I would wait awhile prior to writing a review, since I wanted to be sure I was being fair and not writing based on my immediate reaction.  Back on January 23rd, I rented a car from Budget at the Orlando airport.  Despite having a reservation, I had to wait in line for an hour due to the lack of attendants.  I was informed my car was not available but for a little extra I could upgrade my vehicle, which I did.  I was told the car was new and I would be one of the first to drive it.  Shortly after I left the airport, I noticed the battery light was flashing, but the battery monitor on the dashboard was indicating the battery was charged.  After a couple of days, I called Budget regarding the battery and was told they would send roadside assistance to look at the problem, but I would need to pay if they were able to resolve the problem without having to bring the car in for a repair.  Now, why would I need to pay for a problem with their car that I did not cause?  Simple, I did not purchase the roadside assistance insurance, which does not make sense. So, the next day I went to a nearby Budget to see if I could exchange the car and was told they did not have another car available, but I could drive it back to the airport for an exchange.  When I described the problem, I was told the car was in \"demonstration\" mode, which is also the reason the radio keeps resetting and the car door would not unlock using the key fob.  He said it's not really a problem, but I would not be able to use all of the functions of the car.  So, basically I upgraded to a car where the battery light kept coming on and I was not able to use the key fob or enjoy the full functions of the car.  I told the attendant the problem when I dropped the car off, but she said she had never heard of the problem and seemed disinterested.\n\nI would not recommend renting from Budget.  Overall bad experience.",

Back in the day it was more of a seafood \"joint\", no tablecloths, just big long communal tables and you had to pay when you ordered and they just brought out the food when it was ready - no waiting for everyone at the table's order to be ready.  It had a fish market on the side. As kids we always loved going there. \n\nMany years later it is now a chain, and I try not to go to chains, but when I am back in Boston - nothing makes me happier than some fried scallops. And nothing is more disappointing than ordering them somewhere unknown, and them being dicey. Here's what I will say about legal seafood, they are damn consistent. The scallops were perfectly fried and juicy, yum and Yum, I always substitute the French fries for their skinny onion rings. I would say I would love if they offered a fried scallop roll, and a clam cake (a weird Providence RI concoction of bready clammy goodness)...But they do not. I sure miss the fried swordfish they used to served back in the 70 - think fish and chips, but the fish is swordfish - it was awesome - maybe bring that back?\n\nLegal seafood is a great place to get your (not-inexpensive) New England fish dish on.",

I do like the freshness of the bowls, I just needed a LOT of hot sauce to make it tasty. The staff were all pleasant and helpful. The place is clean and a nice option to sit down without feeling too fast food-y. Still, I'm glad there are places like this. Maybe I didn't find the bowl yet that suits my tastebuds.",

       "text":"Reviewing Schmidt's Sausage Haus shouldn't be necessary for anyone familiar with Columbus - Schmidt's has been a Columbus staple for over a hundred years and is hands-down the best German food in town, and one of the best overall restaurants as well.  Located, naturally enough, in German Village just south of downtown Columbus, Schmidt's is just off the beaten path and can be slightly difficult to find if you don't know what you're looking for - but it's well worth the search.  German Village is one of Columbus's most interesting and attractive areas, and the Schmidt's building itself is a registered historical landmark.  When you do locate Schmidt's, parking may be difficult, as the lot directly next to the building is small and fills quickly, but there is another lot for further Schmidt's parking just to the East, across the street.\n\nInside, everything is decorated with an old German feel, from the wooden floors and thick wooden door at the entrance, to the bar with the taps in old \"keg\" facades, to the staff themselves, dressed in old-world German costume.  Due to it's popularity, Schmidt's fills very quickly, but the wait doesn't often get too long.  The popularity also means that the restaurant itself can be somewhat cramped - tables are very close together and servers may bump into you trying to get to their corner tables.  If there is a wait, and you need to kill some time, wander across the street to the fudge shoppe and take a look around - and maybe grab a free sample if you're lucky.\n\nThe menu offers a breadth of German cuisine, from schnitzels to spatzels to sandwhiches and, of course, sausages.  Schmidt's signature item is their Bahama Mama - a spiced sausage available in both regular (moderately spicy) and mild (not very spicy), but they've also won awards for their bratwurst, and serve an excellent garlic knocwurst.  The sausage sampler entree offers a half length of each and is a great way to get a taste of each - served with chunky applesauce and hot kraut.  If straight sausage isn't your thing, you can try the \"Mama Ruben\" - a Ruben with a Bahama Mama patty instead of corned beef (or pastrami), and excellent schnitzel as well.  Frequently Schmidt's has a buffet going, which offers all the sausages, some pasta dishes, potato salad, kraut and soups and salads - it's a smallish yet decent selection and a good price.  One thing not available at the buffet, however, is the excellent potato pancakes.  Either order them as your meal's side or as an add-on side - they're not to be missed.  To make them truly grand, try them with the fresh horseradish.  For dessert, well the obvious choice and specialty is the cream puff - ranging from mini cream puffs to jumbo cream puffs, there's a size available for everyone.  Vanilla is always available, and chocolate is frequent as well, but occasionally there are other special flavors... the double chocolate being a highlight.\n\nService at Schmidt's is most often excellent, though it can suffer slightly during fairly busy times.  Even when ordering the buffet, servers are very attentive to drinks and other needs, such as bringing extra buns and condiments on request.\n\nSchmidt's is a must-do for any fan of German cuisine, from the hardcore to the casual sausage eater.  It's a true Columbus landmark, one of the few remaining, with both the Kahiki and the Jai Alai being torn down for \"progress\".  The prices are great, the service is great, and the setting is great.  The location can be somewhat difficult - at one time there were two other locations, one on Henderson Road and one in Westerville, but sadly both of those have closed and only the original remains.  Thankfully the original seems to be going strong, and will hopefully continue providing incredible German food in a historical setting for years to come!",

The selling point for me was the new Essie gel colors that my current salon wasn't carrying.\n\nI had a bit of trouble finding the location, but I blame Google maps for that.  I walk in and was greeted by the girl at the front.  I didn't have an appointment but was seated immediately after picking out my nail colors.  The nail technician was so wonderful.  He wrapped my nails to get the gel polish off and immediately offered me something to drink.  I opted for the Deluxe pedicure because why not?  It was heavenly and was completed with an orange scrub and lilac scented massage oil.  \n\nAfter my pedicure was complete he got started on my manicure.  He took the foil off of my fingers and it was amazing, all of the nail polish was gone! He didn't need to scrape or drill my nails at all.  I had also broken a nail badly and he patched it right up.  My nails look perfect and long, which doesn't happen often.  I will definitely be back to this place!",

From there I checked out their website and decided to reach out to the spa over Yelp. The owner, Doina was quick to get back to me and put me in touch with her daughter, Raluca.\n\nI would like to add, I was organizing this booking from Australia so I couldn't just call in with the timezones making it difficult. However, Raluca was extremely understanding, patient and helpful. Through email, we were able to book August 15th for our bachelorette party of six girls. \n\nWhen we arrived, Raluca lead us through the salon down to the basement level where the spa is located. I must say, being a Spa and Salon I wasn't sure what to expect. Some places that try to do both just don't do it right... this is not the case for Toscana. \n\nThe spa level was quiet and separated from the noise of the salon, it was beautiful, clean, comfortable, quiet and our spa party had the area all to ourselves. There was plenty of space to sit down, relax and chit chat between services. \n\nBathrooms were also located on the basement level where you could change into the big comfy robes and slippers they provided. \n\nAnother appreciated detail, for spa parties they provide fruit, chocolate, juice, tea, coffee and mimosa. Everything was delicious and Doina and Raluca frequently checked in on us to see how we were doing. At times, they even joined in on our conversation and silliness. We absolutely loved them and felt like we were at home with old friends. \n\nAs for services... how often can you bring six girls anywhere and not get one complaint? In this case... not one. All the girls got massages (some Swedish, some Deep Tissue) and facials (some standard, some acne treatment, other microdermabrasion) and all left with smiles on their faces and full of praises.  \n\nMost of the ladies (with Raluca and Doina's help) picked out skin care products to purchase and most of us (the girls who live local) plan to make another trip down to Toscana the weekend before the brides wedding.\n\nToscana is the perfect location for a spa party for any occasion. Can't wait to go back! \n\nThank you so much Raluca and Doina for making Katie's big weekend out so enjoyable-We look forward to seeing you again!",

My boyfriend got the original ramen with extra noodles and felt like there still weren't enough noodles compared to the amount of broth. Overall, he liked his though.

The place is super intimate and reminds me of Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco in terms of its size, set-up, and vibe. I didn't even know TT's was just around the corner from the Middle East until I actually searched for it. Sound isn't exceptional, but the atmosphere is great. Cheap tickets and a good place to catch up-and-coming artists.",

Told them I was planning to get rid of my car within 6 months so didn't want to sink a lot of $ in it.  Brought it by at my appointment time; inspection took an hour.  Repair job took 2 hours (L. Schwab said it would take them one hour.) However, not only did they fix a burned out light at no charge, but my bill came to less than their estimate, which saved me $71 over Les S's estimate; they said my calipers didn't need replacement. An investment of 3 1\/2 hours. but  at least it's easier to kill time on Hawthorne when on foot than it is on Sandy Boulevard. By the way, I have a large, older car which I was unable to get into a parking space in their small lot.  They were nice enough to park it on the street for me after it was repaired. I can't remember the last time I had the wonderful experience of any business telling me I owe them less than their estimate.  It could be they always over estimate to make the customer happy with the final bill, and if that's the case, it works.",

First, no longer is Bragg's available as a condiment but instead just plain old soy sauce.  That in itself was a huge disappointment, but then it seems their Yumm sauce is Bragg's free as well.  Not the same sauce without it.  \n\nBut what I didn't realize was that there was another big change to their flavor base in their Yumm bowls.\n\nThe black beans seemed to be cooked without any salt.  No flavoring whatsoever. Bland.  Bland beans.  Yuck. \n\nThe brown rice seemed to be cooked without any salt.  No flavor whatsoever.  Just flavorless fiber.\n\nThe seasoned fried tofu seemed to also be cooked without salt or soy sauce.  A slight curry flavor, but without any saltiness altogether.  Yuck.\n\nThe meal tasted like I was eating at the Mayo Clinic and I had been diagnosed with heart disease and they weren't going to let me have any salt or flavor in my food.  What a waste of ten dollars.  \n\nEven the salsa on top of my Yumm Bowl was bland.  Was it just me?  NO.  My friend who had ordered a side of black beans with her meal threw the whole serving away saying those were the blandest beans she'd ever eaten, and she used to love their beans.  \n\nI don't know if it is just this store that has decided to go flavor-free, or if the whole franchise has ditched Braggs and salt, but until they go back to their original recipes, I won't be going back.",

There seemed to be only 2 genres \/categories for the cds: \"budget\" and \"rock\/r&b\", and the physical layout of the store seemed odd. I was not able to locate any of the artists that I searched for, which was frustrating.\n\nIf you are looking to sell your cds & dvds etc, I do not recommend this place. I'm not sure how the buyer decides what to buy; it does not seem to be very scientific. Not once did she check a computer while trolling through my titles. How does she know if she has several copies of Miles Davis' Love Songs without checking the computer? Can you ever have too many copies of anything by Miles Davis? I knew that my cd collection was a bizarre mix of genres and not very up to date, but they offered me 1¢ per cd for several hundred cds. While I was browsing the store, I saw copies of cds that I myself had brought in that day. They were selling for $3.75-$8.50 each. Yet these were the same titles that I was told were worth only 1¢. I ended up selling about 10 cds for $49 and taking back several hundred cds that would have earned me only an additional $6. That is tricky math, if you ask me. If you have no use for the cds, why even offer me 1¢?\n\nBesides my bitterness over the 1¢ cds, the staff was not friendly. I had to flag down help, though 3 staff members were standing around with no customers in sight. When my friend entered about 5 minutes later (after parking the car somewhere far, far, away), she was asked \"Do you need something?\" from across the room, as though she was someplace she did not belong. Neither of us felt welcome, so I pocketed my cash and left. I will spend it somewhere else.",

Everyone speaks English well and they are always nice and pretty friendly. They have tons of polish colors to choose from, but the best part is the massage chairs. I would happily pay $25 just to sit in the massage chair for 45 minutes, in fact, last time I came, I sat there for an extra 20 minute cycle while my polish dried since it wasn't that busy.  On that note, they are almost always busy, so if you're in a time crunch, call ahead for an appointment. Highly recommended.",

While visiting friends in Columbus, I suggested we try Schmidt's as recommended by another friend in Phoenix. We drove at least 45 minutes to eat there twice during our 5 day visit. \n\nThe first visit, my husband and friends ordered the buffet and they were pleased. I think I ordered a Reuben sandwich, but since I was anticipating the cream puff, the meal portion is a blur. I love Sauerkraut and I'm pretty sure whatever I ate had some on it.\n\nThe cream puff.. Oh, the amazing cream puff. It's definitely big enough to share, and unfortunately that's what my husband wanted to do. I surely could have eaten one on my own in 1-2 sittings. :)\n\nTwo days later, we were about 90 minutes away and casually mentioned cream puffs in conversation. (We all do that, don't we?) We made a venture back to Schmidt's to order cream puffs to go. We devoured them on a nearby bench and drove back into the country with giant smiles on our faces. \n\nOur friends have since moved back to Phoenix and I'm trying to think of a good enough reason to fly back to Columbus. I still dream about those giant, amazing morsels.",

In my experience, the people at the register just want me to finish and move on. I would not mind a slightly more welcoming environment on that front. Yes, I come at lunch, but there are other gin joints in the world that are more happy to see me.\n\nWhich leads me to my next thing, the food isn't really all that healthy it seems to me. I got the medium sized Yumm Bowl, which I think was about 775 calories. I mean, that's a lot of calories. I looked it up and The Breakfast Crunchwrap at Taco Bell is only 700 calories. I know what you're going to tell me, a calorie isn't a calorie, blah blah blah blah. The ingredients here are organic and better for you, blah blah blah. But, that's just a lot of calories. I am not saying the menu is deceptive by any means, and I'm also not saying that the food isn't tasty, but you really need to read up on that.

       "text":"A friend and I were looking for something quick and casual to eat near Midtown, as he could be called back to work at a moment's notice. I wanted something savory and thought that Papi's would fit the bill. \n\nBeing located near Ponce and Piedmont, parking can be a little difficult to find. Most of the streets nearby have free street parking, but boy was it packed. The atmosphere of the restaurant was what I expected - cozy, albeit noisy. We didn't have to wait long for a table.\n\nWe opted to split the Cuban pork dinner and the jerk chicken sandwich. The pork was a little dry for my taste. With a little hot sauce, it became more palatable. I liked the rice and potato pancake that the pork dinner came with. The jerk chicken sandwich was spot-on. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The toppings of Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mustard were nice. But the bread was what really sold me! The outside is slightly crispy and the inside is chewy and soft. I devoured the sandwich like nobody's business. Thankfully I didn't have much GI distress.\n\nWe ended dinner with a cup of Cuban coffee each. My standard for Cuban coffee is based off of a little stand somewhere in Miami. Coffee was strong, but not extremely sweet. I found the Cuban coffee at Papi's to be overly sweet. You could feel the sugar  on your tongue and sliding down the side of the cup towards the end. \n\nI would definitely come back to this restaurant to have their other sandwiches. I'm also interested in trying their plantains!",

Unfortunately, our last three visits have steadily gone down hill from the overall service to the quality of the food. We decided to give it one last try for happy hour yesterday and we will never return. My favorite thing on the menu the cherry blossom was not only underwhelming in the presentation, there was a huge shell that was only 1\/4 filled with ingredients, but the taste was awful! The tuna was such poor quality that I couldn't even eat it.  No amount of sauce on that thing could save  it! We finished our drinks asked for our check and left completely disappointed.",

I could eat that by itself!\n\nGranted, my mom's potato salad is a bit better than Schmidt's- this one is a bit too sweet for my taste. It needs more vinegar, more bacon fat, less sweet pickle. But then again, everything could use more bacon fat.\n\nOH, I almost forgot to tell you about the giant beers! They don't serve liters of beers, but to me that's a good thing, because I have very weak biceps. They do serve a mean 24-ouncer. I recommend the dunkel. It's dark beer at its finest. Dark, but with a light taste. More flavorful than American beer, yet not as heavy as a microbrew. Practically beer perfection, if you ask me. \n\nThere's an oompah\/accordian trio most weekends.

       "text":"The only problem I have with this place is that I tend to walk away with some goods on each visit.  There is such a great  variety of selection ranging from vinyl to CD's to DVD's, etc.  I can spend easily an hour plus browsing through what they have.  The used CD's are pretty cheap, about $8.50 or less for single discs.  Sometimes I'll find CD's that only have been out a month or so and already on the used clearance.  I have noticed too that all of the used CD's minus the SKUF's(meaning pretty bad scratched)  are in excellent quality.  I think they clean them before they are put on the shelf but I'm not certain.  I like the fact I can listen to any CD before I buy, which has helped me quite a bit determining whether to buy or not . I did kick myself because I saw a rare copy of the 2 disc \"Big Trouble in Little China\" last week.  I decided to get it the next day because I was not feeling well when I saw it displayed.  The next day after recovering I saddened to see it gone.  So if you really want something you spot, go with the urge and get it because it may not be there the next day.  One of the few great independent music\/dvd stores I will continue to shop even when the corporate stores have been closing down like the Virgin Records store in Denver, CO.",

       "text":"I went to Dr. Hicks after being referred by my GP for chronic tonsillitis and throat infections. After one look in my throat, Dr. Hicks suggested a full tonsillectomy. I asked him about the procedure and he was very forthcoming and informative. I went to the Austin Diagnostic Surgical Center off 360 for my procedure and the whole thing went very quickly and without a hitch. I never saw Dr. Hicks the day of my surgery though. The recovery was very rough, as expected, and Dr. Hicks' associate Dr. Bryarly was on call through the weekend. I had more communication with him about recovery problems and he was very helpful and always returned our calls. I was admitted into the hospital on Day 3 for dehydration and extreme pain and Dr. Bryarly was there to check me in. Dr. HIcks did eventually show up to my room the next day and didn't have much to say. He didn't even look at my throat, which I thought was odd. He did however prescribe me some great pain relievers which helped the rest of my recovery to be far less traumatic. But as far as the surgery goes, I was out like a light before I even remember being in the operating room. The wounds were very clean and neat, so to speak. My uvula was not swollen a bit, this can be a problem from doctors banging around back there. My face wasn't sore and my tongue felt untouched. I read a lot of stories about the horrible tongue pain (from the mouth clamps they use) and I had no issue.  Based on videos I've watched and information I've read about tonsillectomies, Dr. HIcks did an excellent job of removing them. There was absolutely no post-op bleeding either. I would recommend both doctors at the ENT department of the ADC. Tonsillectomies are MUCH harder for adults and it won't be a fun or easy ride, but I'm glad it's over and I believe I was in good hands.",

       "text":"Upon arrival there was a dispute between the southwest airlines crew and the front desk. I was really uncomfortable. Basically, a crew member (who wasn't working a flight) wanted to ride the airport shuttle. The hotel told her that she would have to pay ten dollars. She asked, \"So you're not going to let me onto the shuttle?\" The front desk guy replied, \"You can get on the shuttle, but it'll be $10.\" She just stood there, mouth wide open, and I couldn't blame her. I'm sure southwest airlines gives the hotel enough business so that a flight attendant can ride for free anytime.\n\nThe housekeepers leave opened soap on the shower, not in the box, which I find unhygenic. I realize the bar of soap is new, but I prefer to open my own box. I also find it a waste to have a new bar of soap every night.\n\nThe hotel is like a maze, centered around a courtyard, and on the bottom level is a pool. You can hear EVERYTHING going on at the pool because windowed doors face the inside courtyard. This also means anyone walking by can peep into your room. I kept my curtains shut the entire time. Of course the nights I stayed there were loud children playing in the pool past 10PM. I don't know if the pool ever closes, but screaming past 10PM seems a bit late. I cranked the fan up to drown the noise.\n\nGetting to this hotel can be tricky. Google maps will tell you to exit (forgot the name) so that there really isn't enough time to get over. You should really take the 290 exit to give yourself enough time. If you miss the street to the hotel, you'll have to go around all the way again. The restaurants next door do not share a parking lot or have a way to cut through to a back road to get back to the hotel.\n\nThere is only one parking garage elevator and the tiny room in which you wait is HOT without air conditioning. I have lived in Texas all my life, and any hotel that does not have air conditioning inside, no matter where you are, is blasphemous. I kept the door to the hallway open until the elevator arrived. Since there's only one garage elevator for the whole hotel, good luck.\n\nAnd speaking of the parking garage, make sure you ask where it is. Since my front desk guy was probably still perturbed by the flight attendant, he didn't tell me where it was. I ended up in the hotel employee lot, so I had to go to the check-in counter again and ask directions.\n\nThe WiFi didn't really work well the first night, and I had to have IT give special permission on all my devices. The phone call probably took about 30 minutes. You have been warned.\n\nThere's no Hilton Honors Lounge like the Columbia, SC location. The two free bottles of water for diamond members weren't in the fridge, so I requested delivery. I've probably stayed at 30+ Doubletree locations, and this was one of the worst. The only good thing about this location compared to others was that there was a fridge (but no microwave). But other than that, there's really not any incentive to stay here.",

I place my order in advance and get 2 confirmation emails. The day of delivery 9am I get s call saying that my card will not go through. This is the only card I have so she tries again & it's still not working. I say Ok can I come by and pay cash in an hour and still have the cake delivered today. The woman tell me yes & that she already authorized for the cake to go out for delivery and she will put a note that I will come by same day to pay cash.

So I tell her ok I will be there at 10am to pay for the cake so it could still be delivered before 3pm (the latest delivery time estimate given) she says actually no it won't be delivered today if you do that. I ask \"so basically I'm out of luck\" she said \"yes\". I was furious. I wrote an email to their customer service.

My cake that I ordered still should've been made and ready to go after cash payment was received. The email response I got was \"Sorry.

It was only the hubby and myself so it was way too much space for only two people.  The kitchen came fully stocked with cooking and eating utensils and a full size fridge.  Two bedrooms upstairs with a full bath and a sofabed downstairs with another full bath; shower only. The food from the onsite restaurant ... well, it could have been better.  We ordered hot wings and shrimp alfredo.  The wings seemed to be old and were hard.  The pasta was good however. \n\nI will definitely visit Saratoga Resort Villas again.",

       "text":"Pittock Mansion is immaculate! Something that the building developers of today could never replicate or come close to matching up with; the quite modern day features of this house were probably a big deal to them back in the early 1900's when it was built; things like massive walk in closets, refrigerators, etc. were pretty genius for back then.\n\nIf for some reason the mansion does not impress you, I sure hope the drive to get there does. The segment of Washington Park extending up towards the house was amazing. Looking straight up and down, the amount of trees and lush greenery. Definitely breathtaking. The views when you get up to the mansion are even better. You can see all of Portland from just about anywhere on the property. \n\nWhere the parking lot is now used to be the old tennis courts of the home. Even the chauffeur's house is extremely nice! Inside the house, everywhere you look there is marble and mahogany, something that costs a pretty penny today, let alone back then. 4,000 square feet on every floor totaling up to 16,000 square feet all together; The Oregonian and other modes of business definitely paid off for Henry Pittock. \n\nThe price is extremely inexpensive to get in and at any age this property can be appreciated. If I ever get a mass amount of money one day, I'd love to purchase this house and live in it for myself.",

I've had authentic Indian and Cleveland Avenue African, and my friend has had authentic Somali\/Ethiopian\/Nigerian in Africa. \n\nHave to admit, my plate, evenly spread between Chicken Suqaar and salad greens, bordered by enjeera rolls, looked promising enough. But half my plate?! Of salad greens? Come on. And where's the flavor in my suqaar? I know for a fact suqaar is supposed to have chili powder in it. It was like eating chicken bouillon. \n\nIn sum, for African, stick to Darbo's or Calanley. This restaurant's food is like Sarah Palin: too much style, too little substance.",

Water was super hot, very very clean, I watched my nail tech take brand new metal tools out of a sterile never opened package. Immediately impressed. The full set I was less than impressed with though. The paint job was good, lasted a long time, no crooked nails, and all of my clients commented they looked real and asked all the time how I got the almond shape, and when I told them I had them done they had no idea they were artificial! However my ONLY issue lays in the application. The glue was put on, ON TOP of the artificial nail after it was already placed on the real nail. This created bubbles on some nails, a lack of glue on others, and some were just fine. So that meant that within a week, my thumb nail broke in half from where the glue was placed, and a few more followed soon. I knew it was strange when she applied it, but obviously she knows better than me and I left my nails up to my tech! They were beautiful while I had them, and I will still go back and try again. Overall very happy with my experience! And looking forward to seeing them again.",

They pulled them apart, brought me back there and showed me where there was damage. They wanted to charge $1200 to fix my brakes! My wife's cousin is a former mechanic in the Marines who wanted to check them out for us. He verified that there was NOTHING wrong with them!! I can surmise that Goodyear did something while my tires were installed to make it look like the brakes were in bad shape, but that is conjecture only and I have no proof, so I won't make that claim. I will say that it's been over a year since that incident and my brakes are working fine!! It's situations like this that give auto repair businesses a bad name. Be very wary of using this location.

       "text":"I am not a high-demand client. For me this is about as perfect as I've ever had for a haircut\/salon\/stylist.\n\nI am half-Chinese, and like to have a fairly typical male haircut. Other stylists in Boston and other cities have such a hard time getting it right. But I described what i wanted to her, showed a couple pictures for comparison, and she took care of it. No kidding, in about 15 minutes of cutting, she nailed it. She even added nice texture and edging.\n\nBut wait, there's more. I've never had to wait for a haircut at this place. Sure, that can be interpreted as bad because there aren't enough clients. But I don't care if there are 0 or 1000, if they cut my hair well, I'll go back. The most people I've ever seen in there is 1 other client. But that just means I never have to call ahead or wait for a haircut.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Before getting your haircut, her assistant gives you a 10-minute shampoo and scalp massage. It's very enjoyable. It's not a luxury back massage with bells and whistles. But they take their time to clean your hair, massage a few points on your scalp and neck, and then a rinse.\n\nAll for $25 (for men).\n\nSo here's the summary: fast, friendly hair-cut, done right the first time, with a little shampoo perk. If you're in a rush, you can be in out and gone within 30 minutes. How can you beat that?\n\nNote: the salon is inside the International Center or whatever building that is, with the glasses\/jewelry shop on the corner and the steam vents pouring out of the sidewalk in front.",

For such a small space I thought that this was a pretty efficient way of taking down orders and turning over customers.\n\nI had the Spicy Miso Ramen with whole egg and extra noodles while the misses had the House Ramen.\n\nThe noodles were fantastically springy and chewy with lots of delicious toppings but sadly, both myself as well as my girlfriend found our broth to be a little bit on the bland side, perhaps because they were so close to being closed for lunch and were low on ramen stock but we found ourselves reaching for the vinegar and shichimi seasoning to give it that extra flavor.\n\nThought quick service and perfectly made noodles, I was sad that Sapporo, for myself personally, did not live up to its hype. Perhaps I just came on a bad day?\n\nI'll be looking to stop by again on a different date to try it's ramen once again",

       "text":"First and foremost: CREAM PUFF.\n\nNow that that is cleared up: I had a blast at Schmidt's Sausage Haus. It's nestled in the center of German Village, which is one of my favorite places in Columbus. As soon as you enter the restaurant you are met with a wave of kitsch, including the live band playing German music and the lederhosen-wearing wait staff. The brick walls, dusky lighting, and dark woods only add to the effect of the place. I've read some reviews that accuse Schmidt's of not being \"authentic,\" which is just silly. In my opinion, Schmidt's doesn't even *try* to be authentically German, but instead present itself as a self-aware, campy German-American getaway that is very light-hearted in nature. The sign even says \"German-American\"!\n\nI ordered the Bavarian cabbage rolls with kraut und pork and green beans and spaetzle. I was very pleased with my meal. It was a huge portion, which was nice given the above-ten-dollar price (which is high for me because I'm a poor college student), and everything was very flavorful. My friend and I shared a draft beer sampler, so I got to try six varieties of \"haus bier.\" However, the highlight of the meal was definitely the jumbo vanilla cream puff. Oh, my word. It was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I've had cream puffs before, but absolutely none compare to the one that I experienced at Schmidt's. My friend and I split it and were in a state of cream-puff-induced bliss for the whole drive back to Granville. \n\nSchmidt's Sausage Haus: a fun, campy German-American restaurant for someone who wants a light-hearted experience, a good meal, and an amazing cream puff.",

It's definitely flavorful on a thin crust pizza so you don't feel so guilty eating it, but I will say it is a bit on the oily side with the pesto dripping olive oil. And since the crust is a bit thin, it does make it a little hard to eat. Spike some pepper on it to balance it out.\n\nSalads are also gigantic.

The staff were friendly and quick.  The chicken breast - perfectly fried and moist.  I would have liked more chicken batter -- because what was on there was so good.  But its definitely close to home made vs a chain.  The fish was just as tasty.  I had the mac and cheese and liked it for what it was -- scooped from a pan like would be served at a family picnic -- dry instead of oozing cheese but I could taste the cheese and even though 'mushy'...it worked.",

The worst customer service I've ever had anywhere! Called them a few times and left a few messages about a missed toll never got back to me and it's been 10 days since I left the message. They pretty much conned me into paying for insurance when I told them I. Wanted to use my own insurance and I didn't want there's. They charged me $ 327 for their insurance and didn't even tell me they were charging me for that or never even gave me a price.  When I tried calling customer service to discuss it they never answered or called back so I sent them an email. I got a response saying i will know their answer is 3 -4 days. 4 days later they put the money back in my account so most of it was spent. Another 5 days later after I returned home I got an email basically calling me a liar and that because I signed the waiver I didn't know was a waiver they were not doing anything and charging me the full amount which was then charged to my account again making my account negative. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I will be sure to never use it again as well.",

       "text":"Bookmarked AND the hubby recommended it. Our first time here. I also brought my aunt along as well. Very casual and laid back atmosphere (Your neighbourhood restaurant but better). We went around 7PM on a Monday and seemed like the better time to go. There were only a couple other tables there. We got the Chicken Satay, Bacon wrapped lychee and pineapple, Papaya Salad, Tom Ka Gai, Yellow Fish Curry, Pad See Ew (Sp?) and Coconut rice. We got Thai Iced Tea and Young Coconut for drinks!\n\nChicken Satay - Usually there are a selection of beef\/pork\/chicken but there was only chicken here. I think 3 skewers would have been better for the price ($6) but we got orders of 2. As tasty as it can be! My only gripe (as with every other Thai restaurant) is that they have smooth peanut butter sauce instead of one's with crushed peanuts in it. I like the extra texture on my skewer. I feel the only place that has done that thus far is Tropika and that's Malay food. AHHHH. \n\nBacon wrapped lychee and pineapple - We all agreed this tasted like a hawaiian pizza without the dough. Fruit was nice and juicy inside. Came with a bed of leafy greens. \n\nPapaya Salad - I had papaya Salad last week at another Thai restaurant and I can def say this is on top of my papaya Salad list. The salad has a bit of a kick to it and super zesty. LOVE LOVE LOVE. \n\nTom Ka Gai - Coconut milk type of soup with lemon grass in it. There was a tiny roasted chili pepper which scared me a bit but there was no spice. My fav soup. Very flavourful. I read another review that the reviewer thought otherwise but I think it might have been a faulty batch as I enjoyed mine very much as did the rest of my group. Good amount of mushrooms and chicken. \n\nYellow Fish Curry - Not too sure what kind of fish is in this but there were LOTS of onions and potato slices. The slices of fish were hellaaa thick slices. Curry pretty thick. We got a side of the coconut rice to eat with it which was perfect! I feel like it was in the middle of mild and medium spice. \n\nPad See Ew - I find that these noodles are different elsewhere!! Again, normally we are given a choice between meats but we only had pork which we stuck with (another reviewer noted you could sub for beef\/chicken). Little pieces of gai lan, mild, kinda salty, kinda amazing. \n\nCoconut Rice - The coconut rice here is REALLY mild. It's almost like a background taste. Thats the best way I could describe it. I had it with the Curry and I think it complemented it very well. \n\nThe Thai iced tea here is a little bit too sweet for me but it was still nommy. There was only two servers working. I can see how service can be slow if there was a full house and take outs involved for that day. At the time we went it wasn't too busy so our servers were very quick to get back to us. In fact, they came back a couple times to see if we were ready to order and how everything was tasting. The food came out really quick and we ordered the whole menu (almosttt). There's free parking in the front (not sure if it is permit parking on the sides). \n\nOH and before I forget... we also got the deep fried banana. Pleasant surprise!! It's like deep fried banana 2.0. Huge scoop of ice cream and 4 pieces of little bananas. They've battered it with some shredded coconut. Was plenty for the 3 of us. We even doggy bagged some of it home! Definitely a must try and I'll be back!!!!",

Broth is delicious and thick with collagen, the pork is fork-tender and the veg balance in the soup is just right (corn, nori, half a boiled egg, scallions and more).

This tiny corner of Hancock St offers a rare experience these days, and that alone can be worth the wait to see (if not at peak periods).\n\nI am a huge breakfast fan, and diner breakfasts are about the best.  While there are some places that offer less wait times, more comfortable seating, and dare I say tastier food, this place combines everything just right for me.  I had a seat at the bar and enjoyed watching the cook prepare all the food.  I thought the breakfast items were quite good and offered a pretty diverse menu.  Coffee was not bad either.  \n\nIf I were to rate all the local breakfast options, I'd place Wheelhouse towards the top.  Here's my unofficial list, not necessarily a ranking:\n\n A Lighter Fare - Nicer space (but can be really busy on weekends); excellent food, but pricier than other places\n Wheelhouse Diner - Tight, can be a wait for a booth; good greasy breakfast food - the way it should be.  Good prices and fun atmosphere.\nNewcomb Farms - Decent food with decent prices, but be warned that they don't offer coffee - they offer coffee-colored water.\nIHOP - Classic chain.  Good pancakes, so-so on everything else.  Worth the wait only when you're in the mood for pancakes.\n\nAnyway, my 2 cents.  I'd default to Wheelhouse when I'm feeling cheap to go to A Lighter Fare.",

I recently had to have my gall bladder removed and he was completely professional, on-point with information, and advised exactly what to expect before, during, and after my surgery. I am eternally grateful to his expertise and knowledge. He got me through some of the WORST pain I have ever had in my life. (I've had some doozies.) This guy is my hero and I recommend him for your surgeon. My surgery on average would have taken 45 minutes. He used a robot and I only had one incision through my navel to have my gall bladder taken out. Healing time was much shorter than the average gall bladder removal and my surgery was only 35 minutes long. I was done before I knew I was in. FANTASTIC!!! I feel great!

The food I got was pretty darn comparable to what you'd get at any other Legal Seafood's outlet, which is a good thing in the life of a frequent traveler.\n\nI'm all about the fried clams, and Legals does a decent enough job with them.  My plate had plenty of them, and they were tender and not greasy.  Not the best I've ever eaten, but certainly very well done.  The guys next to me were raving about their lobster rolls, but I was on my way out of Boston and had to go with my clams.\n\nIt's not cheap, but for that price you get good food, and my service was prompt, friendly and professional.\n\nI almost escaped New England this trip without eating fried clams, which would have been a minor tragedy.

Maybe she was just having a bad day but going to the doctor is not always fun and anything that could be done to help make it a more pleasant experience would be really appreciated.\n\nThe technician that did my blood work was excellent. I have small veins and she was able to collect the sample with the first attempt. Very happy for that.\n\nThey recently moved to a new location so I was expecting to see a welcoming decor when I arrived. It looks like a very stuffy office space, not warm and welcoming. For a place that focuses on being About Women and By Women I would expect to see a place that is welcoming and warm and nicely decorated. Not drab and depressing.\n\nOverall, I have an appt coming up again and we'll see how it goes.

We started with the appetizer platter which had Papa Rellena (perfectly crispy outside but still soft in the inside, Croquettas Jamon (great ham flavor), and Chicken Empanada.  I could devour a plate of the chicken empanadas all by themselves and be happy.\n\nI had the Ropa Vieja and it was so tender and juicy.  The yellow rice and black beans are completely to die for.  And the plantains were perfectly ripe with the light sweetness... fried but not greasy.  Hubby had Pan con Bistec sandwich.  Not too much mayo, bread was still soft on the inside with a great crunch on the outside.  Meat was tender, and the swiss was strong enough to hold its own in the flavor category.\n\nTHEN... the Flan.....  Seriously, some of the best I have ever had.  Texture of the  custard was beautiful, caramel sauce not too thick and not too sweet, and the crunch from a little bit of shredded coconut on the bottom... mmmm...mmmm...mmmm....\n\nEven without a Groupon, the prices are super reasonable, especially for the portions.

Keen eye, he noticed my Salmon Burger was missing it's sides and he immediately went back to grab them for me (thanks)! \n\nThe Salmon Burger was $8.95, a price I couldn't pass up. However, I got what I paid for and was underwhelmed with blandness. I could have probably made it myself and the chips on the side didn't have much taste to them, either. My friend wasn't too keen for her Deli Lama sandwich, but the other three friends enjoyed their bowls which I guess is what this cafe is famous for! \nToo bad for buyer's remorse! \n\nDon't forget to bus your tables.",

       "text":"Piece of Cake honored the store credit so I picked up the replacement cupcakes the other day from the Camp Creek bakery. In addition to the cupcakes I ordered, I decided to purchase one red velvet cupcake available at the counter to eat on the way home.  The red velvet cupcake was so moist and delicious and reminded me of the wonderful cupcakes served at my friends party.  Unfortunately, when I got home and shared the cupcakes I ordered with my family, I was very disappointed. I ordered yellow cupcakes with chocolate frosting and red velvet cupcakes. I sampled one of each after my mom tried one and said they were dry. And yes, again both were very dry. Well, I really don't know what to say. Another batch of dry cupcakes and I did not put these in the refrigerator.  I guess ordering the cupcakes in advance means they bake them in advance and leave them out to dry.  I still have store credit for several more cupcakes. So maybe the next time I order, I will order the day I pick up versus ordering a day or week in advance. In the meantime, I will be in the hunt for another bakery. I'm giving this 3 stars only because they honored the store credit and the cupcake at the counter was so delish. I still have faith in Piece of Cake and will give them another chance.",

Like others got to airport only to wait in line, then wait some more. Total time in line 1.5 hrs! That is just ridiculous to me. Some agents waited on 1 person whole time i stood there. Customers were all annoyed. Had i not prepaid I would have left because cancel fees were extreme. No choice but to stand there.  The $10 savings just not worth it. Other rental companies had no wait! Girl who waited on me was pleasant & helpful when I finally made it to the counter. Still had to wait though for her to locate my car another 20 minutes. No cars were back that i requested. Look elsewhere is my advice. Customers actually cheer when you make it to the counter. Pretty funny. Did eventually get the car I reserved after almost 2.0 hours I will never get back.",

Though the service provided was good, after I came home, I realized my toe nail paint wasn't completely dry and got smudged completely. I called them and they asked me to drive back (10 miles). They promptly helped me with a fresh coat of paint. But after living my toes to dry for more than 5 hrs, when I wore shoes, the paint got smudged again. I don't know if it was the quality of polish or the weather - I was severely disappointed. I have had pedicures numerous times in the past and never faced such issues. After driving back and forth twice, I had no patience or time to go back thrice. \nAgain - no issues with the service, but I feel sad every time I look at my toes :(",

My aunt, who lived in Germany for a number of years, came to visit from Illinois and she really wanted to go... so we set out on a chilly December day.\n\nOur party of 3 had to wait only 15-20 minutes on a Saturday for lunch. I couldn't make up my mind, so many things sounded so good, so I settled on getting the sausage sampler platter since it was my first visit.\n\nI was certain that my favorite would be the Bahama Mama, especially with it's popularity, but I was surprised to find the knockwurst was my favorite.\n\nI really was craving red cabbage but found it to be okay at best. I prefer sweeter type, so was a little disappointed. Afterward, I noticed a sweet cabbage on the menu and next time I'll give that a try and see if it satisfies me.\n\nNot a fan of the potato salad... it's warm and that's not my thing. \n\nI'll finish with this simple statement: GET THE CREME PUFFS. Yes, you want one each. Yes, you want to get different types and share. You will not regret this unless you don't follow my advice.\n\nTschus!",

A few months ago I got food poisoning and had to go to the urgent care at Far West. That experience in and of itself deserves a five star review.

First time I lost my Blake's v-card, I was a little nervous (as you can read below) but the booze helped.  The second time I was here, I was so drunk that I forgot multiple times that I was even in a gay bar.  I apparently asked my friends a bunch of times, \"hey why are there so many guys here?\"\n\nThird time was fun again, went on a friday night.  The drag show is fun as always, and some good entertainment.  I have to say, we wound up talking to a ton of other straight people, so it's definitely friendly to non-gay men.  I would say a good 20% of the people here were straight and just looking to have a fun time.\n\nIt was... interesting to finally understand a girl's perspective of dealing with people passing you in a crowded area.  I personally tap the shoulder and squeeze by but i've heard from women that they get flat out molested when someone squeezes by them.  This visit to Blake's, I got all sorts of odd methods for dudes to pass by me.

I don't live in midtown anymore so I don't go as often, but this restaurant is definitely legit- right down to the colorful interior and the curt attitude of the waiters (if you've ever eaten in Miami, you know what I'm talking about).\n\nMy only complaint is that it is a little pricier than my favorite spots in Miami. I guess you're paying for location and ambience though. If you're new to Cuban food, I recommend Croquettas Jamon, Ropa Vieja, Frijoles Negros, and Maduros. Frijoles Negros and Maduros are typically served as sides. Flan or Tres Leches goes without saying :)",

For 14$ you get rice krispies and \"sauce\" of your choice to go with it and in this case I went with the seafood one which includes scallops, squid etc.  We also ordered the hot and sour soup; a small size will feed 3-4 people which I was quite impressed with.  We also ordered fried dumplings, steamed dumplings, and fried bread.  The fried dumplings looked a bit soggy and too oily for my liking (even my mom can cook better ones) and the fried bread was also not crispy.

       "text":"We stayed here for 5 days in Feb 2016 - 2BR, 2Bath - Q bed in one, K bed in another, with 2 adults and 1 child. It's really nice to have a 2-level hotel - the kids can sleep and you can watch tv and finish dinner downstairs, and sit on the balcony. The bedrooms are spacious, and the beds are decent. The pillows are odd - 1 is not puffy enough, but 2 are too puffy. Not a dealbreaker though. \n\nKitchen has set of 6-8 plates\/mugs\/glasses. (No wine glasses). A pan and a large pot. Utensils and a few knives, cutting board and a corkscrew. No peeler. Kitchen includes sponge, Dawn and dishwasher liquid. Target is right next door, and sells all groceries. SUPER CHEAP. We bought frozen meals to take with us to Disney, heated it up in the AM and ate it for lunch there. We came home in time to make a quick dinner. Saves so much $. \n\nNice dining table, and living room. We had no issues with the place, except that the housekeeping was not that great. Towels weren't replaced, nor were toiletries until we asked a third time. Hair was on the floor, and didn't get wiped up. I think they just do a topical cleaning - wipe and vacuum and call it a day. After a day or two, it doesn't feel like you're coming back to a cleaned-up hotel room, but to your own messy home. But all in all, it was still a worthwhile place to say. Just make sure you're on the front desk about them cleaning up your room. \n\nThe location is great. I can't believe people want to stay on the Disney property to save time or whatever. It takes an entire 10 minutes to get to Disney, and a few extra minutes to park. And you get an entire apartment to stay in. Most, if not all, of the Disney property hotels were just 1-roomers, and cost upwards of $350 a night. We found a Groupon for this place, which made it very cheap. So look for that. \n\nUm, be aware that the \"lake\" is a big pond, and you're really not going to be walking around it much. It's a nice touch but not anything to write home about. The photos on the hotel website seem accurate. We had carpeting in our living room, not tiles though. We usually like a hotel with a kitchen, and this one had a very decent one. 4 people can stay here comfortably. Maybe 5, if you put 3 kids in the King and the 2 adults in the Queen. The sofa is also firm enough that 1 person can sleep on it, if they don't move around much!",

It was not busy due to a storm.\n\nYet, the rack of ribs was burnt and tasted old. The smashed potatoes were hard and cold. The portions were smaller than they used to be. I was there with two friends who ordered steaks. All the meat tasted old, and was not seasoned. We used to visit this restaurant regularly, and it's sad to see the decline. \n\nThe atmosphere wasn't as fun either. The talking animals were apparently not working at all. I'm surprised it still gets business, and definitely not the way it used to be.",

I can't believe I haven't visited this place before - Let's Roll is amazing and delicious and priced just right.\n\nThe variety is mind-boggling: they have pretty much all the usual suspects except unagi (eel), and they even have soybean sheets for not just wrapping (in place of the usual seaweed), but seasoned as a veggie option! They also allow you to pick your choice of rice at no extra cost! The best part, you can get crab meat as a topping as opposed to a filler inside the roll. I think that's amazing, since crab meat is delicious but takes up real-estate.\n\nAdd another $3 on top of your roll for some sashimi and it's a done deal for the husband. Since I just can't eat that much, one roll is more than enough for me (ten pieces!). Drizzled in your choice of sauce (or you can do half an half, which is even better if you're undecided although the blueberry mayo is delish)and you're good to go!\n\nLet's Roll - I love you.",

He was impressed and very happy he listened to me.\n\nI came in on a Sunday and we got sat ASAP; luckily because 10 minutes later a TON of people came in, but they got sat quickly too.\n\nOrdered a bottle of beer. It came out quick and with a frosty mug. Nice touch. I ordered the buffet and started eating right away.\n\nNormally when I am hungover, I can hardly eat a thing. Not this time, I killed two plated of yummy food. It was rare, but it doesn't surprise me, the food was amazing.\n\nThere were 4 types of sausage (all good) and a sausage stew. Fried chicken, meatloaf - one of the best I've ever had, it had a nice soft texture and a marvelous taste. They had Redskin mashed and mushroom gravy, awesome Mac and Cheese - I still dream of this Mac and Cheese, saurkraut and red cabbage with beets in it (freaking amazing, both of them).\n\nThey had German potato salad which hit the spot, but not in big doses. They even had a salad bar which I didn't visit, as I am a male.\n\nThe food was hearty and the time was good. Five stars. I totally want to go back and just eat desserts next time. They looked so gorgeous up in that case, so massively big  Cream Puffs. \n\nThanks Yelp, my mouth waters now. Great place though, check it out!!!",

I agree that the broth is a bit \"thick\" in the house ramen (lots of collagen) but I think that is the point and one of the reasons it is so delicious...at the very least not any less delicious than thinner ramens I have had...it just makes it a bit tough to eat such a large bowl.  The veggie ramen and miso ramen broth are pretty light.   Tan tan mein is thick but again, that is the point.\n\nMy favorite by far...by FAR...is the Hot and Sour ramen.  The Shitake mushrooms, I think, are sauteed in the tears of supermodels and then sprinkled with the same stuff that tinkerbell puts on Peter to make him fly.  If you don't understand what I am saying, I am saying that the Shitake mushrooms in the Hot 'N Sour ramen are reason enough to go here.  \n\nSometimes they run out of ramen around 8pm even though they are open until 9.  I see it as a sign of legitimacy that they can't just quickly whip some up (read: they take 12 hours or something to make the broth).  \n\nIt's especially fun bringing people to porter exchange for the first time because they are always so blown away...so do it.",

We were actually driving around the area looking for the location of another car detailing business but when we called them, we were told they were actually a mobile business and had already closed for the day. We happened to see that Bright Car Wash was on our route home and decided to drive up. It was 5:35 and we weren't sure if they'd take us since they close at 6pm and there were several cars still being detailed ahead of us and knew it would take them past their closing time to add another to the mix. Brandon was adamant that the last car was taken at 5:45 and he welcomed us through their line. \nHe and his crew were phenomenal! They were friendly, professional, & extremely detail oriented. They even removed our Weathertech floorboard liners out of the vehicle and scrubbed them clean! I have NEVER had a car detailing company do that! That alone was enough for me to decide to come back! We were the last car in their line that evening and even though it was dark and past closing time by the time they were finishing up our car, Brandon and his crew chatted & joked with us and never made us feel like we had burdened them by arriving close to quitting time. \nOur vehicle was thoroughly clean and shiny after we left. To be honest, you can probably find any place to just clean your car, but it's much harder to find such detailed work along with the friendly and exemplary customer service we received at this establishment. And for that, I have forgotten about that mobile car detailer and will now continue to bring my car to Bright Car Wash instead!",

They did the right thing and comp'd it but it was disappointing to say the least.\n\nOverall, good food, good service, cold beer.",

Overall, I think they are fine and that's about it. \n\nMy first visit to this location was to dine in with a friend cause I received a coupon to use in the mail. I hadn't eaten at a Chick-Fil-A in years, but I figured what the heck. I ordered a chicken sandwich and thought it was OK. \n\nAnother visit was to grab a breakfast chicken biscuit as they were offering a deal. So when they offer these deals, the lines can be crazy. What is particularly annoying about this location is that customers do not follow the posted signs. If entering from North Druid Hills, you are supposed to drive AROUND the building and then get in line. Those waiting at the entrance to the store just create a problem and are jumping in front of people who were there before them. Ugh. The chicken biscuit was fine. \n\nThird visit to the store was to get a milkshake. I went in cause apparently sometimes they give a discount to military in uniform. My friend had hyped up their shakes to me so I had high hopes. But I just found it to be OK. Nothing special. \n\nI have also had catering from Chick-Fil-A multiple times (not sure if it was this location). I do like the nuggets and the various sauces that come with them.",

For a $40 ($48 with tip!) pedi I expected it would be above par and it wasn't any more special than going down the street to one of my local places. \n\nMy tech was running behind and the receptionist kept me updated and offered me water.  She helped me pick a nice spring color after I told her what event I was attending. The tech was super nice and spoke English but I definitely had some concerns.  There was no trimming of cuticles or other skin around the toes. I told her twice it had been 6 months since I had a pedicure due to an injury-pretty sure I needed a complete overhaul. (I later went home and did it myself.) The polish was gummed up and nasty. She tried to smooth it out as best as possible but I knew it would never last. Here I am a week later and polish is chipping and heaped up around the edges of my nail. \n\nI think the thing that got me the most and should have been a red flag was that they ask you for a credit card up front. Maybe they've had a lot of no-shows and that protects them but really, it's just tacky. I won't be back.",

The red beans under sell themselves as it is not just red beans but a chili like mixture with sausage and veggies mixed into a gravy. I immediately pour the red bean mixture over my beef and rice to create a delicious stew. If this isn't enough deliciousness for you, the fried plantains are the best I have had and complement the savoriness of the meal with sweetness. \n\nAnd the bread....

       "text":"While I miss the sweet couple that ran Kiwan Cafe Rio, the new owner of B Street Coffee House is very nice and gave the space a much needed facelift. It is cleaner and brighter inside. She kept the gluten free, vegan waffles and mine was light and delicious. There are a very few places in town I trust with my gluten free, dairy free, soy free dietary needs, but B Street Coffee House didn't let me down! The Dutch apple topping was not as generous as the previous owners but when she served us the waffles she let us know if we wanted more agave syrup or cinnamon to let her know. So we did ask for more and the extras flowed freely! I also asked about the creamy stuff served on top, which is a vegan topping made from nuts. She gave us more of that too! \n\nThe biggest improvement is that they now serve Nossa Familia coffee! Whatever they served before was awful. Nossa Familia coffee rocks!\n\nService is slow but in a tiny space where your order is custom-made, you should expect less than immediate results. Personally, to me, this adds to the charm of this tiny place: there is abundant time to enjoy the company of those you are dining with! The new, clean high tables with comfortable bar stools made the time pass quickly.\n\nOne disclaimer: I am not celiac. I can't review from the standpoint of cross contamination. My gluten\/dairy\/soy intolerances are significant and I have never felt sick after eating here, but again if you are celiac you should review on your own criteria.",

They have live crabs, clams, shrimps and lobster, and what looked like tilapia all swimming in tanks!  We didn't get any seafood (just had a crab feast and have salmon in the fridge).  But it looks like a great resource, the prices were very reasonable and live is the way to go with seafood.  \n\nThe veggie section, while small, was full of fresh good-looking produce.  I picked up some beautiful, absolutely perfect bean sprouts, bitter melon ($1.99\/lb, not bad!), a huge and juicy ginger root, basil and mint.   They also stock Bui tofu puffs, which are a local product from Portland, so I got a package of these as well.  Bitter melon and tofu soup for dinner tonight!  Glad I checked Ocean King Market out, it's going to be on the regular grocery rotation I think.",

It's within walking distance from my apartment so I keep seeing their colorful hand-painted sign and wanted to give it a shot. We sat near the bar and luckily didn't have to wait for a table, even though we waited a long time for our order to be taken and to receive our food. The atmosphere is perfect for an authentic Cuban restaurant. It reminded me of the time I got drunk and went to Taco Cabana and truly thought I was in Mexico, except this time I was sober. Our waitress was the spitting image of Penelope Cruz, and her accent made me momentarily forget what I wanted when I ordered. \n\nThe Authentic Cuban Sandwich is the absolute best I've ever had. It was a bit cold on the inside, but it was amazing. I don't even like mustard but when in Rome...and devoured it without barely chewing. I just wanted it in my stomach now! The maduros (sweet plantains) were the perfect compliment to any sandwich. They cook them like only a real Cuban place can - with the soft, fleshy inside and a crispy caramelized skin that blends savory and sweet perfectly. \n\nThe price is very inexpensive compared to the quality of food. I didn't even make it half a week before I went back again for lunch and tried a pork wrap which was also tasty. I'll definitely make it a frequent place now that I've tried it.",

My partner and I both love architecture and property, so we might have a greater penchant for this sort of thing, but the views of Portland are definitely worth the stop.\n\nThe mansion was lovely, and I appreciate how they provided insights to the interior of the walls, and saved original flooring, and other tidbits like that. We hopped onto a tour, our knowledgable and fun guide was great. Mr. Pittock must have been quite a character, and I'm grateful I got to learn about him and the history of his family. \n\nI'd love to go back around Christmas and see how they decorate the mansion for the season.",

       "text":"I would give another half star if Yelp allowed it (c'mon, yelp), as the food was neither bad nor good.  Just mediocre.  I started with some drinks - the sangria was good, the mojito loco (which is a frozen mojito) was good, and the Long Island Iced Tea was decent.  \n\nI had not time for an appetizer as I was under the clock, so I ordered the masitas platter (pork cubes marinated in garlic and deep fried).  They came with two tostones (green banana salted fritters) and congris (or moros - which is a pre-cooked blend of white rice and black beans) plus a small piece of buttered, toasted Cuban bread.\n\nI am Puerto Rican and grew up as a kid near Little Havana in Florida.  I know from Cuban food.  So here is my review.  The tostones were perfect. The Cuban toast was perfect.  The congris was incredibly bland and not nearly cooked properly.  With proper moros, the rice should be almost pitch black and there should be stray bits of roasted pork thrown in to salt it.  There was no pork and the white rice was barely blackened, as if they simply mixed white rice and black beans (which is not congris, moros, or moros y christianos; sorry guys).  The biggest problem was the masitas.  They tasted okay.  Not marinated enough and flavorful enough, but the pork was lean and clean.  The problem is when I got them, they were so white I thought they had mistakenly given me chicken.  I had it sent back and it came back still underdone.  Not undercooked, but the outside of masitas (juicy or dry) should be a dark brown for the most part and not white or barely golden.  The guy said they would do them again for me, but I had no time. They were edible, decent, but not Cuban.  \n\nOne of the people working there admitted that people complained originally that they were too well done and wanted the pork juicy.  Well, you can make masitas juicy and dark brown. I've had them all my life. I cook them at home.  I don't mind dry, as I prefer it to trichinosis.  \n\nAnyway, one final note.  The police seem to love it as no less than 6 police cars pulled up to come in and eat.  Maybe you'll like it. It was not empty.  I did not find it to be authentic at all.",

Our water was polite and efficient despite appearing a bit frazzled from running around. We started with the sweet BBQ wings which came out quickly and were tasty. My friend asked our waiter about the marinated feta salad and he raved about it, explaining that the feta is marinated in herbs for at least a day in advance so she decided to order it. The salad was bland and the feta tasted and appeared to be plain and not marinated at all. \n\nI ordered a burger and we ordered a side of sweet potato fries. The burger was decent, nothing spectacular, but we got waffle fries instead of sweet potato and when we alerted the waiter, he said he would bring sweet potato fries right out to us. They didn't actually come out until we were ready for the bill so we packed them to go.\n\nBut here is the real kicker. When delivering our food, a different waiter accidentally knocked over a full glass of ice cold coke directly into my lap, soaking my shirt and shorts, and legs. He felt terrible and brought over tons of napkins to help clean up with. I'm not normally the kind of person that complains a lot at restaurants or gets bent out of shape about mishaps, but considering I had to eat my dinner while completely saturated in cold coca cola, I was kind of expecting a visit from the manager, some deductions from the bill, or at the very least a heartfelt apology. I received none of the above. I get that restaurant mishaps happen but when a restaurant doesn't respond in an attempt to rectify, that is a bit concerning.\n\nNow, I'm not saying don't ever go to this restaurant - but maybe wait a few weeks until they get into the swing of things.",

A table of 6 completely finished eating and ordered maduros to go.... Every table around us received their order. Does a Cuban sandwich and shrimp take an hour?!?

I've had, and absolutely loved the cream puffs at different outdoor events, but for some reason I never had the desire to eat here. After finally trying it out, I'm full of so much regret. I could have been enjoying this long ago! I've enjoyed the $9.99 Friday buffet at least three times in the last month - delicious! Everything is hot and fresh. The best brats, German potato salad, corned beef and cabbage - okay, pretty much all the items are very good. Service is good, atmosphere is cool - authentic German pub style with wait staff dressed in German attire. Every time I'm there I catch myself staring and wondering if the employees like their uniforms, I don't think I would. IJS. Although I've only had the buffet, I think it's by far the best deal. The menu prices are definitely reasonable but you get such a variety on the buffet. Oh, of course you can't forget the cream puff either, pure deliciousness! Apparently they have seasonal flavors, they had peppermint over the holidays. So, it's a good chance on any given Friday at lunch time I'll be here!",

I went to see him about it, and he said it would need to be redone.  I allowed him to correct the problem by redoing the surgery (at my cost), which only made it worse.

Old man Pittock may have stood knee high to a pygmy but he spared no expense when it came time to build a really nice house for himself and his family.  Kudos to the Pittock Mansion caretakers who have painstakingly restored the entire place authentically.  The information on the placards in each room did a great job of pointing out the most interesting and less obvious aspects of each space.  \n\nI have to take them to task for their holiday decor, though.  We were told that each year they Foundation decorates a different holiday theme.  This year is was Disney (groan!) SO...each room was also adorned with a Disney theme (Snow White, Beauty & the Beast, etc.) It was really tacky and took away from the whole experience.  I understand why they do it (to increase traffic at that time of year--especially families & kids,) but it could have been done tastefully at least.\n\nThankfully that's only a holiday thing.  In spite of the cheesiness we really enjoyed ourselves here.\n\nUpdate: I was recently informed by a Mansion board member that 2007's Holiday theme was \"Fairy Tales\" and not Disney.  It just so happens that many classic fairy tales have been co-opted and retold by Disney, thus the use of Disney props and memorabilia.  I still think the aesthetic appeal of the mansion was ultimately and unfortunately sacrificed--no matter what the theme was.",

I will admit, at first we walked to the actual Budget Rent A Car counter and assumed we were going to have to wait 3+ hours to get our car. BUT I knew that wasn't right or how fastbreak worked. We called and was told to actually cross the street into the parking garage. We waited 5 minutes, the asked for my ID (probably to make a copy) and then handed us paperwork. She said to head to our car and that the keys were inside. The only negative was the car we asked for was not what we received, but in all honesty I never have rented a car I had originally asked for. I complimented the staff for being so efficient. We had a Kia Soul for a whole week for $159.00 after the 30% off coupon. Even returning the car was a breeze. I did not feel rushed as we emptied the car. We will always book budget again now.

When I called him at 4:53 pm, he said that he won't be able to make it that day because he was called in for a different work order.  I understand that this may happen, but how is it that the update was given to me 7 hours after I was expecting someone?  I specifically asked the person the day before that I need to have some updates via phone\/text in a timely manner so that I'm not homebound all day.\n\nUpdate: \"The garage guy should be giving you a call within 5-10 minutes\" -Juan\nWhat really happened: I did not get a call from the garage guy until 2 full days later.  When the call did come in, he asked if he could come by the next day instead because his wife was sick in San Antonio.  I told him to take care of his wife and to come the next day.  The next morning, the garage guy sent me a text saying he was on his way and was extremely helpful upon arrival.  Bravo on his work ethic.  According to him, he did not get the work order from the property management company until 10 minutes before he called.  My question is, why was I told that I'd be getting a call from the garage guy in 5-10 minutes when he wasn't even given the work order until 2 days later?   \n\nUpdate: \"I'll have a person call you as soon as possible to give you an update\" -Mary\nWhat really happened: No one gave me a follow-up call that entire day.  As per usual, I was left hanging.\n\nUpdate: \"I'll come out tomorrow morning to replace the lights in the kitchen\"\nWhat really happened: No show in the morning and no updates until I called later in the afternoon.  The update at that point was that the ceiling fan was no longer being carried by Lowe's and that he had to special order it--I don't understand this either because the ceiling fan is not the same as the one before.  Why not buy a different one from the get go and not have to postpone the work order for over 4 days? There were no updates on the kitchen lights.\n\nI just spoke to David in the office about the work order that needs to be submitted for the power shortage in the Master Bedroom.  According to Juan, it may just be that the circuit breaker for the Master Bedroom needs to be replaced with a 30 amp one.  I realize that I don't have to be at the property when the maintenance people are here, but since I am not comfortable with that, I have had to take the last 5 days off due to unfulfilled updates from the company's maintenance team.  \n\nI hope that this review will give this company an update on the poor workflows of their maintenance team and I hope that they will be addressed soon.  In my 6 years of being a renter, I have never had issues such as these.  I will update this review upon getting a response from the manager.",

Their crust is pretty thin and nicely crispy (unless you get the veggie kind, where it tends to get quite soggy). The pies are modestly sized (again, compared to NY), a \"large\" wasn't so large but enough to satisfy 2 people, maybe maybe 3. The bruschetta was good - olive oily, garlicky with big chunks of tomatoes. Their beers and wines are modestly priced also!  A sam adams + a mini bottle (1\/4 real bottle) of pinot was $10, not bad at all :)\n\nThey have a communal table set up in the middle of the room, with a few small tables for outdoor seating - it's a great place to grab a bite without feeling rushed or that lingering awkwardness of attempting a sit down meal at a pizzeria.\n\nThe kitchen area is wide open for the viewing and is very clean - said I, the appreciative customer :)",

Richie is a working class guy that cuts hair all day like the rest of the guys. In my opinion that is a truly professional management style. \n\nI have seen all types of people getting hair cuts in there and a few girls too. The price is about $12 for haircut and trim beard. Its easy to hang out and wait in there too because most people are friendly and the attitudes  are checked at the door. \n\nI have something in common with a bunch of the guys who work there and that is we are automotive enthusiasts. So that always gives us something to talk about,\n\nGo to Richie's if you need a good haircut. They are the best ones I found in town so far.",

This is a bit different but very delicious and satisfying: I continue to always order the hot and sour ramen with extra noodles - my favourite.  I was there again on a chilly day yesterday and I always arrive early so I do not have to wait. I always have the same server who is always friendly. Once again, it did not disappoint. So I would disagree that the place has changed or gone 'downhill'. I enjoy going to the Shops at Porter for both ramen and other Japanese food and for shopping  the nice Tokai nearby. That's one of my traditions. I will go often this winter not only because I love it but because it's something like cold and flu medicine in this season! And I like to take the train to Porter from Boston and then walk all the way back to Downtown Boston. I will share with friends this winter, also. Thank you, Sapporo!",

Their wet burrito for lunch is simply delicious, but should not be consumed entirely if you are planning to work afterwards! This is because they are HUGE!

Did NOT try the sandwiches there, but they are incredibly popular, so definitely try one. \n\nIf you can, try to sit near the window, because lighting isn't exactly this place's best asset. And if they are busy (which they usually are on weekends), don't expect to be seated or fed right away. THAT is how busy they are.\n\nLastly, prices are some of the best.

Our friends who live in Columbus had been there before, and assured my husband and I (both well-seasoned foodies from New York), that we were in for a treat. They were most certainly right! We walked in to the restaurant and were one of only three parties at the restaurant, something that usually sets off a red flag for us. However, once we had our entrees, we were completely enthralled with the delicious, complex, spicy flavor in each one of the dishes. My husband and I both ordered the vegetarian sampler, and our friends ordered the goat and the chicken. The vegetarian sampler is basically an ethiopian dish; deliciously spiced lentils, cauliflower, collard greens, cabbage, and salad over injara. It is definitely as good (if not better) as any authentic Ethiopian dish I've had in New York  or Philadelphia. Our friends said the goat and the chicken were divine - perfectly tender, deliciously savory, with just the right amount of spice. The owner himself even came over and asked how things were toward the end of the meal.  He was very warm and welcoming, and we could tell he was genuinely interested in our comments. Throughout the meal, we kept saying to each other that we couldn't believe this place wasn't packed. Solay Bistro definitely one of Columbus' best-kept secrets. We'll definitely be going back next time we're in Columbus!",

I get to the location and there looks to be at least 30-40 people waiting in line. There are 2 representatives at the kiosk and 6 empty kiosks. Each representative takes about 10-30 minutes talking to each customer. Every once in a while, a 3rd and 4th representative show up and then 5 minutes into their job, they leave the customer hanging to go away to chat. I finally call the customer service line, I tell them I want to cancel my reservation and get my money back since the line is not moving. They say they will transfer me to a supervisor and I'm put on hold for 10 minutes without anyone picking up. This happens 4 times before I am finally able to speak to a supervisor who tells me that waiting one and a half hours and being late to a wedding is not a good enough reason to get my money back. When I explain that their location is severely under staffed and incapable of handling the capacity of people, he reiterates his previous comment. Eventually after much frustration and anger, he agrees to refund me. It is not past 4pm. I saw so many people leave and go to other rental agencies because they couldn't wait. Terrible service on site, even worse over the phone. If you see a line at this rental, save yourself the headache and frustration and get your money back.",

       "text":"I used to love Bugaboo when I was little, and when the one in Watertown closed I was pretty disappointed, so imagine my happiness when I found out there's one still open in Braintree. Unfortunately...it's pretty awful. \n\nThe bread they serve is okay, but it's clearly trying to be Outback bread, which is infamously good, and theirs is just a cheap imitation. Side note: boyfriend is in love with Outback bread, so a few months ago I tried to make it for him. This was the first time in probably ten years I made bread from scratch and while it wasn't as good as the real thing, it was waaaaayyyyy better than Bugaboo bread.\n\nI got the Black Magic steak with asparagus. The asparagus was almost raw, had an unpleasant taste, and I got the distinct impression that it had been microwaved. Bleh. \n\nNow on to the steak. This steak was terrible. The waitress hovered waiting for me to cut it to ensure it was cooked properly, which is fine I guess but really awkward. It was cooked fine, but OH my glob did it taste bad. The seasoning was just confusing and gross, aside from a lot of salt I couldn't identify a single flavor.\n\nI absolutely hate sending food back, but I had to. I didn't want to say, 'this tastes like it fell on the floor' so I just said it was too salty, and the waitress seemed really confused...? She told me it was seasoned, and then came back to say it was Cajun seasoning. I don't think anyone working there has even been in the same room as Cajun food.\n\nThe manager came over and while he wasn't exactly rude, he seemed almost offended, and again mentioned that it was seasoned (yes, I know, I read the menu description, thanks). He just kept harping on the fact that it was seasoned as if I couldn't understand it. Like Bugaboo is serving up such exotic food that my peasant palate just couldn't handle it. Whatever.\n\nI got their chicken sandwich as a replacement, it was pretty average. Not bad, not great, just a thing. Boyfriend got a burger, said it was just okay. The manager kept coming over to ask how it was going, and talking to the waitress. I'm not sure, but I got the impression that he was mad at her, as if their crappy food is her fault.\n\nOverall, huge disappointment. The service was fine, the manager was annoying, the food was terrible.",

       "text":"Right next to the Middle East Club is another decent place to see a band.  Their ongoing problem is that they're sound person sucks.  The PA system is a constant frustration when seeing a rock band -- you either can't hear any vocals or you get crappy distorted vocals.  But it's a definite improvement over the cramped quarters of the Mid East Upstairs.  Anyway, they have two pool tables here.  That's a rarity in Cambridge, and that's why I'm tempted to give it four stars... let's say 3.5.  And the tables aren't right up against a wall like in some other bars (I'm looking at you, The Field) -- you can actually play a good game here.  The cover is usually pretty cheap, which is nice, and the beer isn't expensive either.  Not much of a choice as far as beers go, but what do you expect?  This place isn't looking to impress anyone.  They whip up decent mixed drinks too.",

       "text":"Bella Mia is a conveniently located hair salon in Billerica Center, situated within O'Connor's Plaza.  Aside from Bill's Barber Shop, they offer competitive pricing compared to other places in town to receive a men's haircut.  This is a full-service salon, so I was often one of the few men that I saw inside.\n\nLisa does a wonderful job and I used to go to her consistently before I discovered another salon in a nearby town that offered better pricing and gave me as good of a haircut.\n\nI felt that the prices at Bella Mia were a bit high, though as I mentioned above, they were still lower than everywhere else in Billerica.  I'm not sure why getting a haircut should be so expensive, especially for something as simple as a men's haircut (most of my haircut consists of using a buzzer).\n\nI was also disappointed in their hours, being closed on both Sundays and Mondays, and sometimes found it difficult to make it an appointment.\n\nWith that said, I do have a good memory of hopping off a local bus from Burlington and getting immediate service.  So my advice is to make an appointment, find someone right for you, and see if their prices are in line with your budget.",

Mind you, the furniture is not all original to the site, but it is all well-placed and appropriate to the space. The place is well-kept and incredibly affordable at $10 for adults and $7 for youth. Compared to other places of similar kind in other metro areas, this is a reasonable price point. Tours are self-guided and engaging for children and adults--my kids (10 and 8) couldn't stop directing me to take photos, haha! We also appreciated some of the more tactile items, like blueprints that you could flip through and stereoscopes that you could switch out with different images. The lower basement floor includes a gallery that shows local artists' work, and it is an example of what I love about Portland in general: pride in their city, support for their artisans. The outside is a great photo op; and the gift shop has some pretty items. I highly recommend it if you are a fan of history like I am.",

Papi's has a good variety of Cuban yummies, including batidos (Cuban-style milkshakes made with fresh fruit; mango is the least exotic), guava pastries, sandwiches, black beans, white or yellow rice, and a daily entree.\n\nIncluding a batido de mamey (mamey milkshake) and a colada (a relatively large serving of Cuban coffee, about 1\/2 cup), our takeout bill was around $21.  I weighed the food (not drinks) when we got home: over five pounds!  Although this isn't a \"comida por libra\" (food priced by the pound) place, that's still less than $4\/lb, an excellent value.\n\nToday's entree was chicken-and-potato fricassee, which comes with (or, in Miami English, \"brings\") beans and rice, a small salad, and four pieces of platanos maduros (sweet, ripe plantains).  My wife liked the potatoes better than the chicken, which suited our cats just fine; they wouldn't stop jumping onto the table when the chicken was up there.\n\nI had the vegetarian special, which included the same beans and rice and platanos maduros, but also a large helping of steamed and unimpressive veggies (the broccoli appeared in two distinct shades of overcooked).  Both meals included a buttered piece of Cuban toast.\n\nI'd skip the veggies next time and just get black beans and rice with a full order of plantains.  Starchy, yes, but delicious.\n\nThe upstairs area is cramped but wheelchair-accessible.  The bar area is downstairs and inaccessible.\n\nThe neighborhood is poor (I got one \"hey, big guy!\" from a gentleman working on his cardboard advertisements), but not scary enough to keep me away from Papi's and its neighbors.",

We finished our meal with their home made tiramisu, and we couldn't have been more pleased. The light cake layers were perfectly soaked through with espresso and the cream was light and spot on balanced sweetness. \n\nBuda has limited dining experiences and Viuda is definitely a diamond in the rough.

So, not one to pass on a suggestion to eat, made a beeline for German Village.  The drive there was nice and I went on a weekday and found a great parking spot close by.\n\nThere were no open tables (a good sign) and I have no qualms about eating at a bar so I sat at the bar and started making friends.  Schmidt's brews their own golden and dark beers, and I had one of their golden brews.  It was tasty and set me up for the feast to come.  The Sausage Sampler plate came with half-size samples of 4 of their sausages on a bed of kraut with mashed potatoes on the side.  The spicy mustard was great with all of the sausages and it was a very good meal overall.  For just a few dineros more I could have had the endless buffet but the plate I ordered was enough, especially if I was to have one of their famous creme puffs for dessert.\n\nI had a choice of chocolate, vanilla or a seasonal flavor of creme for the puff.  I took the original vanilla and was not disappointed.  Glad I saved room because it was a giant of a creme puff.  Look at my photo and be amazed.\n\nI have give give props to Trey the barkeep who kept the convo going with interesting tidbits about German Village history, neighborhood happenings, and Columbus culture.  Very cool dude.  \n\nAnyway, next time you happen to find yourself in Columbus, make it to Schmidt's and you will be glad you did!",

Though the concept is somewhat similar at Restoration Hardware, RH takes more of an architectural approach to design. Their stuff also does a great job picking up industrial textures in a comfortable way.\n\nItems range from affordable gadgets and dust-collectors to ridiculously overpriced leather furniture pieces that look like they were attacked by cats.",

I went in for a quick shellac manicure and an eyebrow wax. Took only about 45 minutes. The shellac looks great, but it remains to be seen how long it lasts. My normal salon (which is no longer my normal salon as I've moved - sad) had the best shellac lasting well over 2 weeks...we'll see how this stacks up. My eyebrows look good, but the waxing area is ... well, it's a chair with a neck pillow stuck behind your head. Hey - it's a tiny space and they have to make it work, I guess! For a quick, lunch-time nail fix - Bromfield delivers.\n\nTotal cost for Shellac plus Eyebrows - $35.00",

I ended up driving to Porter Square alone this week to get some. Unfortunately, my trip aligned the Boston anime convention, so everything was crowded, but I got a table alone in a few moments. There are about 5 tables here and the service is super speedy. The Spicy (Pork) Miso is great. Huge, filling. It's meant for one, but it's hard to finish. I did, but I was really craving it.  I wish it was a little spicier, but there is some sauce to add on the table.  I hate trekking out here for Ramen, but Allston is almost as far as a trip from my apartment. Back Bay is lacking on the Ramen.  Sapporo is located in the Porter Square Shops next to a few other Asian hotspots.  Go hungry.  Also, its cash only, but a bowl won't push you over ten bucks.",

It's probably one of the best cups of clam chowder and best lobster rolls that you'll find in the area. Yes, you'll pay a pretty penny to eat here, but if you're traveling for work and you can expense your meal, you should definitely eat here. If not, you should just treat yourself and save yourself from eating soggy salads or mediocre sandwiches.\n\nAverage prices are probably 20-30% more than if you were not in the airport, but that's usually the way it goes when you eat in an airport and want a decent, fresh, hot meal.\n\nThe clam chowder in a cup ($6.95) is delicious, rich, and super filling - you could probably just have this for dinner and be okay. There are a lot of chunks of clam in there, and it's some of the best clam chowder I've had.\n\nThe lobster roll is also delicious, served on a proper buttered white bread lobster roll, with big chunks of lobster. The lobster is served in a light mayo sauce with fresh celery, and it's not too heavy on the mayo. I loved it and wish I could have had more. It comes with Cape Cod kettle chips and coleslaw.\n\nI've eaten here twice and will definitely come back again. The food comes relatively quickly, so you could sit down and be done eating in 20-30 min. There are also power outlets underneath each seat at the bar, and lots of TVs to keep yourself entertained.

Parking can be a little rough as their lot is kind of narrow.  The food is always good.  The drink menu is fun.  The servers are really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  They have outdoor seating.  Inside they have games on TV.  Really, a nice place to get a good dinner and servers that make you feel wanted!  Also, as a plus, this location never seems to get as rowdy as the two Cambridge locations, and I like that.",

From the number of cars in the parking lot, we thought it was going to be busy but were pleasantly surprised to see that the restaurant was quiet.  We were seated right away and introduced to our waiter, German, who did a terrific job that night.  We received our apps (soup and salad, bread) very quickly and our entrees were delivered not long after.  My Ravioli wasn't very warm but was still served in an attractive way.  Each table has a mini tablet to play games etc on while waiting for your food.  Playing games gets $1.99 charged to your bill, FYI.  The nice thing is, we were able to pay for our bill through the tablet right from the table.  Very convenient!  We frequent this restaurant every time we visit Kissimmee and have never been disappointed during any experience.  We will visit again next time we are in town!",

It would get all tangle and form a bird's nest.  Hair was falling out in clumps every time I brushed my hair.   My one good infallible quality ceased to exist anymore.  \n\nAfter 1 treatment with the L'Occitane Olive Paste for Hair, my hair regained some shine and the frizz disappeared.  I was able to brush it without a painful operation AND very little hair fell out.  \n\nAs amazing as this product is, it only works like a dialysis machine.   It doesn't treat the root of the problem and I have to do the treatment twice a week to maintain good results.\n\nAs for the sales folks, they completely ignored me.  I can only blame myself.

OLD SCHOOL HOTEL and OLD finish-outs (like a $79\/night hotel at most)...the 6th floor rooms look NOTHING like the photos online.  Our room was borderline GHETTO.   Definitely FOR CERTAIN not at all worth the almost $300\/night premium we were charged.  The ONLY reason we were forced to stay here was because the entire town of Austin was booked up for ongoing weekend events.  Otherwise, we would have left immediately.   The room that we were cursed with (room 678 on the 6th floor) wasn't worth a lick.  We even had to call downstairs to ask for an alarm clock that wasn't broken.  Total nightmare of a hotel.   The bathroom was no better.   Low-grade finish outs, and high grade PRICE.   Will NEVER stay here again.",

I can't even remember what else I had before, maybe a filet. This place is much more of a good-time neighborhood pub than a restaurant. Clearly someone made the business decision somewhere to make it that, not hire really good chefs and not worry too much about the grub. \"They'll come anyway so why bother,\" I'm sure they figured. Too bad as with just a little more care and thought they could make halfway decent food. But they clearly cannot be bothered.\n\nBut if you want a place to hang out with your co-workers after 5, drink some good beer and eat appetizers you could do worse. But my wife and I are Burlington residents and, generally speaking, avoid it. (For the record the three times I went were firstly to try it out, the second two times were business meetings).",

Having been to Thailand I would compare this to one of  their local eateries where you get good Thai food in a plain simple setting.\n\nFor two people we shared a papaya salad, tom yum koon, green curry chicken, and an order of pad thai. The dishes were pretty small for the price and I was a still a bit hungry after my meal.  But I do have to say that the quality and preparation were good. \n\nService was good, the waitress who was not Thai had a good understanding of the food and preparations.",

The bar seems to be the only place to get service. \n\nI ordered the chowder and three oysters. \n\nThe chowder was bland, needing salt and even a dash of Tabasco, which I don't normally do. It was filled with clams, which was great and I ended up picking out most of the potatoes with a fork. \n\nThe oysters were tasty but I couldn't shake the feeling that they bought them in bulk and saved the shells to re-serve. The oysters didn't lay in the shell or even look the right size. Each shell had the telltale murky liquid filled to the brim. They also weren't connected to the shell in any way. I guess you can get away with that when you're so close to the ocean. Damn shame though. At $3 an oyster, I'm sure they're making a killing. \n\nI ordered a crabmeat roll to go. I have a long flight ahead of me. I'll report back on it.\n\nUPDATE: The crab roll was PHENOMABALLS. Really, really good. Fresh crab, perfect, buttery roll. Sooooo good. They get an extra star.",

       "text":"Without a doubt, the Pittock Mansion grounds have the most spectacular view of Portland that includes Mt. Hood in the background. Moreover, you can walk around the grounds for free. The only admission fee is for a tour of the inside of the mansion. While you can certainly drive up to the parking lot of the mansion, there is also a beautiful hike from the city that takes you to the top of the grounds in an hour. I started my hike at the entrance of Lower Macleay Park. I walked on the Lower Macleay trail to the Wildwood Trail. As you walk, you will see a Stone House on the right. You need to continue straight and follow the switchbacks to the Upper Macleay Trailhead then follow the signs pointing you to the mansion. It is my favorite hike within the city. However, I wish I did it in warmer weather. As the temperature during the week was below freezing, there were entire parts of the trail that were covered with ice. I was also wearing old running shoes that did not have much grip left. Consequently, I slipped and wiped out three times. During one of those times, the path was downhill so I sat down and slid down because I knew I would wipe out if I tried to walk anyway. On another segment on the hike up, I was struggling and grabbing on to branches to pull myself up. A girl walked by and asked if I was \"ok\" then immediately wiped out and fell on her rear end. Her companion laughed hysterically at her. He explained that he is \"not a bad person\" and he only laughed because he had already fallen 5 times and it was only her first time falling. As I made my way up to the mansion, I realized I had already tried my luck a lot. As a result, I decided to take a cab back to the bottom where I parked. The $10 fee was well worth avoiding a potential broken arm if I fell hard. There is also a limited amount of parking at the entrance of Lower Macleay Park. There is street parking nearby but it is a 2 hour limit. Without losing some time to navigate the ice, I definitely could have made the round trip and enjoyed the view in less than 2 hours. Of course, park at the top of Pittock Mansion and do the hike in reverse if you want to take your time to enjoy and cannot get a parking spot at the entrance of Lower Macleay Park.\n\nIf you are visiting Portland or hiking in the nearby area and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile.",

       "text":"If you're visiting German VIllage, you need to eat German food. So, forget about burgers at Thurman's Cafe and pizza at Plank's. Instead, go to Schmidt's Sausage Haus Und Restaurant. Not only is the food authentically German here, the waitstaff dons German garb and the restaurant itself is on the national registry of historic places! \n\nSchmidt's Sausage Haus is amongst the cobblestone catacombs of German Village and can't be missed, as it has a wooden cut-out of a German man and woman that are waiting for you to take your picture with (there's a spot to have your face be their face). There is ample parking on the street and in Schmidt's own parking lot behind the restaurant. Major plus.\n\nInside you will first see a display case with Schmidt's FAMOUS cream puffs. SAVE ROOM FOR THE CREAM PUFFS! One is plenty for a table of two, three, four, or five (if you eat one of those massive pastires by yourself, you probably will gain 6 pounds in one sitting and I would definitely judge you).\n\nThe menu is pretty fantastic. The pretzel starters are \"sehr gut\" (very good) as they say in German. Get them and split them! The best option for your visit (and in my opinion the best deal) is the buffet. It is $9.50 for the all-you-can-eat buffet where you can sample various sausages and other menu items. Most other dishes cost more than this, and you'd be limited to just one entree and 2 sides. So, why people ever get anything other than the buffet is baffling to me.\n\nSchmidt's is known for its Bahama Mama sausage, which comes in mild and regular. It is supposed to be really spicy and out of this world, but to me is not very spicy at all, and while it is good, I am not sure why it is so raved about. I much prefer the regular bratwurst and the sausage stew. The sides are fantastic as well: sauerkraut, potato salad (not anything like you'd see at any potluck around...it is vinegar based rather than mayonnaise based), mac and cheese, potato soup, beets, green beans, etc. There is also a salad bar and homemade applesauce.\n\nWhile German food is never my first choice when dining out, you HAVE to eat German if you're in German Village, and Schmidt's is where it's at!\n\nPS: There is BIER too!",

I would advise taking the tour on your own instead of a volunteer guided tour.  There is a lot of information on the room descriptions that wasn't included in the tour guides' descriptions so it's just as easy to go on yourself.  It is a very interesting house with an interesting history.  Definitely worth the trip.  And if old houses aren't your thing, the view is spectacular on a clear day.",

I've had eggs both over easy and over light and they were both cooked perfectly. For sides I've tried the steak patty, the chicken patty and now the salmon patty. All are breaded.

After a few Google & Yelp searches I was able to find a place open all year round. It's so hard with a winter bday to enjoy certain activities to their fullest so when I came across this place it was like luck had struck! \nIt was as windy as you could imagine, and just as cold- dress warm and wear gloves, it's the only tip needed and followed.\nSince it was that certain time of year where everyone is bundled inside next to a heater, we were out there on the course alone. \nIt was confusing at first but it was our first time here- although it's safe to say it won't be our last!! They have a birthday special (ID proof required) for a free game. \nThe ladies in the office were so sweet and patient, although completely baffled as to why we were crazy enough to be out there. Our visit was a memory that'll last forever.\nWe played both mini golf courses, 18 holes each, the course was fun, some of the holes need updating, and you can't help the leaves or debris since the wind has a mind of it's own- but an update on the course layouts (re-apply fake greens) and shine\/clean up the obstacles on the grounds. You can see that it's a well loved & played through place.\nMaybe when next time we might play one of the actual courses!!",

They had a pretty nice and cozy spot. About 3,000 sq ft if I remember correctly. Very narrow, but cute and just enough space. \n\nWe then made our way up to the mansion, paid our $11 admission fee, and made our way in. Since it's the holidays, they decorated which was a bit much in some areas (Christmas trees in every room). Took away from the artifact. But in some areas, like the library and music room was beautiful. \n\n The furniture is not exactly what the family used, however, it's about what it would have looked like with donated items from that era. Some areas throughout the house have original items locked behind glass, which is what I love to see. The house is gorgeous, with the architecture throughout and the history associated is amazing. What a family!\n\nThe house also overlooks Portland and you have a perfect view of the mountains on a clear day. We were able to see no problem the day we went.",

It's like a little Asian food court, and Sapporo Ramen is nestled among the small Asian, mostly Japanese, restaurants and bakeries.   \n\nI opted for the regular bowl of ramen and a side of steamed pork buns.   The broth reminded me a lot of the Akamaru Modern at Ippudo in NYC.  My problem with the broth in general is that it's extremely rich and creamy.   It is delicious but because of the fattiness in the broth, I become full very easily.   I've heard that each region in Japan offers different kinds of ramen, and apparently the ramen at Ippudo is from a region that offers a richer broth.   My thought is that the ramen at Sapporo is from the same region.   \n\nI've had ramen broth elsewhere that's lighter and less rich - which is my personal preference.  Overall, Sapporo Ramen is definitely a great deal!   If i were nearby, I definitely would stop in but I'm not sure if I'd make a long commute just to have their ramen.",

We were watching the men's final at Wimbledon.\n\nApparently - they are used to men going there also because my technician already knew all the typical answers before I even asked for them.

The Vietnamese really know how to massage hands and feet. Awesome!! That definitely is the best part!  Trust me...every time I travel I go look for places like these. (The best I had was in Shanghai, CHINA. Thirty minute massage AFTER the manicure and pedicure....very cheap and good.) But THIS place is the next best thing to China. Great service and good prices! \n\nWill definitely come back again upon my next visit to Orlando. Professional service, warm smiles, and great prices!",

Their beers are modestly priced and delicious! They have sandwhiches, pastas, fresh salads, calzones, wraps and stir fries, as well as deserts (the baklava is heavenly), a kids menu and more.

       "text":"A restaurant that has ranged from a 1 star terrible experience to a 4 star excellent experience.\n\nI've been to this restaurant twice and had wildly different experiences. It mostly had to do with a particular waitress who didn't understand that 5 is not 4, so I'm willing to somewhat overlook that experience. I'll go through both below:\n\nMy first experience at Vietriver was great. I came in with my wife and her parents one weekend and we were able to sit down right away. The interior is a little 1980s, but it is right on the water and has a decent amount of seating. The waiter brought us our menus and went over the specials they were running. We decided to try a couple Vietnamese beers and cocktails. Everyone placed their orders (I got the ginger chicken, which is really really good) and our food was brought out fairly promptly. The main complaint was from my father-in-law since his chicken soup contained huge pieces of chicken still on the bone, which required him to pick it out of the soup to remove, but everyone was generally pretty happy.\n\nMy second experience at Vietriver was terrible. We came in with 5 people, but the waitress sitting us down only heard 4 and sat us at a table with 4 chairs. We asked her for a 5th chair, but she ignored us so had to go find our own. They then brought us 4 rolled silverware rolls and 4 menus. We once again requested a 5th set of items. She said she would bring them, but she never did. We should have known to leave at that point, but we carried on anyway.\n\nWe looked over the menu and everybody decided to order a wide variety of things since the menu is so large. I decided to get the short ribs my mother-in-law got last time. We placed our order and then we waited. And we waited. And then my mother-in-law's food came out by itself. And we waited. And they finally brought everyone else's food...except for mine. I asked what happen to my food, and the waitress confusingly said she'd look into it. 10 minutes later, a young man comes over, tells me that the kitchen didn't cook my food because they thought we only had 4 people. He apologized and brought me some spring rolls and a piece of lettuce (which you can see in the pictures). It was a little odd, but I was hungry and I ate it.\n\nAfter about 5 more minutes, they finally brought out my food. Unlike my mother-in-law's bowl last time, my short ribs were a mixture of scalding hot and cold (which I've since learned means they were microwaved). It seemed they panicked and threw something together really quick. I asked them to box everything up and we left. The one nice thing about everything being associated with the number 4: only 4 items were listed on the check. I'm not sure if we were comped or that just was going to happen anyways.\n\nOverall, Vietriver has the potential to be a great Vietnamese restaurant on the water. However, it's hard to recommend going there when the service on my second trip was about as terrible as it can get. My recommendation: get it for takeout.",

When I told them to forget the appt  since it took hours to contact me; they had the NERVE to say they would charge cancellation fee!!\n\nYou do not tell a customer that them booking an appointment \"screwed up their day today\" and then ask to reschedule only to charge cancellation fee because your business could not accommodate and certainly not in a timely manner. It should not take hours to decide if you can or cannot accommodate a client.\n\nI still would have returned on Friday for a Pedicure had they not charged me a fee for cancellation because of THEIR screw up. Unfortunately I will not recommend this place and will not return. Not that I even got the opportunity to be a new client in the first place.",

Hearty comfort food. Everyone at our table enjoyed the food. I'm not a fan of bratwurst or sausage, so this just isn't my kind of place.  You won't leave hungry, that's a guarantee.",

Came for lunch one Saturday afternoon (love that they open for lunch on weekends) and got the green curry and pad thai lunch specials. at only 12 dollars each and accompanied with a salad, we even had leftovers! (UPDATE: I THINK PAD THAI IS OFF THE LUNCH MENU) \n\nthe green curry was very good not being too spicy but flavourful enough and full of chicken and veggies. the pad thai was also great (although i don't have much to compare to) because i didn't feel like it was full of ketchup! I'm not sure what they use but it was a really authentic flavour, wasn't clumpy or wet and was a great size! \n\ntried the maw-gang - taro root, coconut, egg and palm sugar - for dessert and it was surprisingly really good! the maw gang tasted like a custard\/pudding\/jello but wasn't too sweet and had a creamy consistency but wasn't runny. the taste of coconut and egg were prominent telling me i should be more adventurous when trying food!",

It was also not very sugary...which I guess some people like, but it is a dessert. The chocolate cream was done better. It had a sort of richness to it. The puff itself was a letdown.

My sister ordered the empanadas they were OK, a little dry due to the fact that they do not come with any kind of dipping sauce.

They were a bit on the little side but had a great crunch and a light sweet corn flavor.  Good as an appetizer.\n\nWe got the crab cake, tuna poke, and fried fish\/shrimp combo.  The crab cake was really good, 100% fresh lump crab meat with no filler.  It did have a little bit of mayo in it which I could do without.  The tuna poke was also really good, get it raw for sure.  The rice and soy sauce were great too.  The main course was the fried fish which was Swai, nice light flaky fish.  The batter on the fish was light and had great seasoning in it.  Good job!  In addition to fish we got the colossal fried shrimp, they were perfectly crispy and so tasty.\n\nNext time I would get the crab cake as a sandwich, think that would be really good.  The tuna poke is perfect, would get again.  I would try the other fish on the menu such as cod or haddock to see how those are.  The shrimp was wonderful, will try the shrimp tacos next time.\n\nI would recommend an upgrade to the beer selection.  They should get more craft beers, maybe ones from Florida.",

There are a couple of options, you can take a guided tour or explore the place yourself at your own place depending on what you're in the mood for.  There is also a \"behind the scenes tour\" that seems to run about once per month where you can see the areas of the mansion that are normally closed off to the public.  This is great place to bring kids or out of town guests.  The outdoor area was also dog friendly so bring Fido for a little exercise.  Assuming the weather allows for it, a nice little picnic in the gardens would really compliment the experience.  They did accept credit cards for admission and could add a donation to your total if so desired.",

I am carribbean and I love carribbean food --especially Cuban flavors. This place missed the mark for a few reasons. I reiterated that I couldn't have dairy, but I got buttered bread --no big deal but it left me a little leary about the rest of my food. I got the vegetarian dish with yellow rice. The beans and rice were delish, the plátano maduros were also done well, but the side of tostones were over cooked into plátano chips :( the veggies that came with my dinner plate literally tasted like they came straight from a green giant can (I am almost certain). It had the watercress, mini mushrooms, and \"can water\" flavor. My husband did say that the shredded chichen--pollo vaca frita was good. But we feel so sick today. It's possible that they forgot about the no dairy, and that's super disappointing . I hate to pay for something that made me sick.\n\nMaybe they were having an off night, but I don't think we'll be coming back.",

After that I believe it goes up to $14. It's not a huge buffet, but the food is pretty tasty and worth the money. My vegetarian friend had no problem finding food to fill up on. Small salad bar, soup, rolls, green beans, a few different types of sausage, German potato salad (vinegar dressing, not creamy - a plus for me as I dislike mayo based salads), mac and cheese, sauerkraut, cabbage, yams, and a few other items. My favorites are the potato soup (top it with a little bit of bacon from salad bar), mac and cheese (it's creamy and saucy, the way mac should be), green beans with spaetzel (canned green beans and balls of dough, no, I'm not being sarcastic when I say I love it), and the sausage and pasta dish that is basically doused in BBQ sauce (the name is escaping me).\n\nTheir cream puffs are huge and pretty delicious, I think the chocolate one is actually my favorite over the original vanilla. There will likely be a little wait, so if you're on the verge of hangry maybe pick up some sweets from the Fudge Haus next door to hold you over.\n\nWhile you're down there, you might as well wander around German Village for a bit as it has plenty to offer and can easily fill up your day.",

Obviously this place attracts a lot of Dim Sum fans, but they also have some solid traditional Chinese restaurant fare. \nWe got the pot stickers, which came fried and tasty and typical. The Mongolian beef was by far our favorite. it was sautéed, spicy and came with some nice veggies. We also got the sesame chicken which was supposed to be spicy but instead was overly sweet. We will not be ordering that again, but other patrons might enjoy it. The rice was nice, the tea was hot and the restaurant was clean.

The bun was good...but it was also slathered in mayo with cucumber and tomato along with the pork. I guess I just wasn't expecting a bun sandwich. \n\nThe ramen. Broth was very tasty and not too salty. The egg, nori, pork and sprouts were tasty. I wish the egg was less hardboiled - I would have liked a runny yolk, but that's just personal preference. \n\nThe noodles were perfectly cooked and so easily slurpable.

We ordered pizza for a meeting a few days ago and it was 45 minutes late.  No apology, no anything but a blank stare.  Thought it was a fluke.  I ordered a few pizzas online the other day for a meeting today and they gave me the wrong order (not enough food).  Again, no apology or any attempt to make it right.  The delivery guy just walked off.  We had to order a few pies from Dimitrios down the street to supplement the order.  Never again.",

       "text":"I have to say that this place was everything we hoped it would be. P.F. it is NOT, and for that, we thank the fine folks at Hunan Lion! We were in the area, and were really craving Sun Tong Luck, but alas, they are closed on Sunday and Monday. We clickly jumped on our Yelp apps to see what else was near, and Hunan Lion roared with some good reviews. We had to try it. It was only about three blocks away, but during the ride over, we were hoping for a giant fish tank, overly friendly\/attentive service, and a totally non-ironic mood set by dim lights, gawdy decor, and a paper liner protecting the table cloth. They delivered on all accounts!\nOur server, Emma, was super nice! She made our lettuce wraps table-side, and put them all together before she left. I have to say that they were the best ones we've ever had. I'd go back just for them, and you get four really big ones for like $7. \nThe General Tso's chicken (yeah, so what) was outstanding. Not too spicy and not too sweet, the pieces were just the right size. Sometimes you get a bunch of way-too-big pieces from some places.\nThe beef lo mein was very good too. Lots of fresh crispy vegies, and small but whole mushrooms accompanied nice tender beef strips and a savory gravy. Again, a simple dish that's served everywhere, but often the beef is way over cooked. Not here though. It was perfect.\nAs with most Chinese-American places, the portions were huge (yeah, we were hungry an hour later), so you'll definitely have some leftovers which they'll box up for you (a dying trend at a lot of places). \nThe place was pretty packed for a Sunday night at 8pm too. Everyone from the blue hairs to the hipsters to a family of Middle-Easterners having a birthday party. Awesome. It's just what we wanted!",

       "text":"Forget the crap food that's been sitting around in stainless steel vats all day at those airport pseudo-restaurants. If you get stuck at Boston's Logan Airport for any reason -- say, your flight is delayed for THREE HOURS -- the Legal C Bar in Terminal B is worth the trip. \n\nThere are apparently two Legal Seafood restaurants in Terminal B: one is behind security near Gate 8. The Legal C Bar is outside security in the public access area of the terminal. It took me about 10 minutes to walk from the furthest gate in Terminal A to Terminal B (there are also shuttle buses between the terminals if you don't feel like walking). \n\nThe food was fresh -- and by fresh, I mean the lettuce in the wedge salad was crunchy, the bacon was real and not some nasty bacon-like substance, and the lobster bisque was hot and had actual chunks of lobster in it. I also ordered the sangria, which was one of the best I've had in recent memory. \n\nThe atmosphere is very bar-like and cozy. There are tables, booths, and a long bar along the window with room to set up your laptop and plenty of outlets for charging up.\n\nService was great despite the fact that numerous flights had been canceled and the place was packed. Soup, salad and sangria all arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. Chris at the bar made a point of asking my name and then using it to check up on me. The extra effort earned him a nice 30% tip.\n\nPrices were reasonable, considering the fact that you pay $8 for a Happy Meal at an airport McDonalds. Total bill was $32, which included tip. Drinks are the pricest menu items. \n\nGreat place to meet up with friends who aren't traveling, since the Legal C Bar isn't behind security. But remember that you will have to re-check through security on your way back to your gate, so be sure to allow yourself enough time.",

       "text":"I tried Bill's after hearing their GF pizza was really good.  I got their meathouse (hause?) pizza and placed my order online.  I don't know if maybe their GF crust is a new item - the online ordering system did not have any place to select a GF crust, nor were any of the toppings marked GF or not.  The only selection was a \"Caution Allergy\" checkbox without, it seemed, a place to actually put what the allergy was (to be clear, GF for me is a preference, not an allergy).  So I asked for a GF crust in a comments section.  I got a call from Bill's immediately after I placed my order, saying that GF pizzas come in one size, large (I had ordered a small) and that the hamburger topping was not GF (which I found very odd and asked they simply omit it).  I do give Bill's props for their very swift resolution of these issues, but it could have saved time and hassle (particularly on their end) by adding options and information on their website.  Granted, I could have called to order my pizza in the first place, but online ordering, even with dietary restrictions, should be simple to do if the restaurant serves items that fit those restrictions.\n\nWhen I picked up my pizza (piping hot!), I was told what I owed - 11 bucks more than the small I originally ordered.  I was expecting my bill to be more since I was now getting a large, but the price for the regular crust large was 7 bucks more than the small, and I was now paying even more than that.  Again, information that would have been nice to have on the website.  I know I could have asked when they called to resolve issues with my order, but I really wasn't expecting that much of a price difference.  It was a very expensive pizza.  When I got it home, the pizza was indeed large (pretty much everything GF is smaller than it's non-GF version so this was nice to see), it was loaded with toppings (many places skimp) BUT the crust was completely soggy.  Not good.  Later I put the leftovers in a skillet to get the crust nice and crispy, which worked beautifully.\n\nOnce I cooked this pizza on the skillet, it was very good.  Toppings were plentiful and fresh and the crust (again, once it was cooked properly), was one of the better GF crusts I've had.  But if I'm going to splurge on a pizza on the pricey end, I'd rather not have to cook it myself.",

The drive up to the mansion is a bit surreal as you're passing through a regular subdivision-type neighborhood, and it seems out-of-place when you're planning to visit an old, historic structure.\n\nThe mansion itself is absolutely breathtaking, we visited on an overcast, misty day and it added an ethereal feel that was altogether charming.  The grounds are wonderful and I recommend walking the grounds as well as touring the house itself.  \n\nInside, you're transported back to another time and the home has been restored so that walking through each room, it is entirely too easy to picture what life must have been like when the home was in its heyday.  The master bathroom contains a shower that is singularly spectacular.  I want one of those in my house!

       "text":"This Target opened up about a couple years ago and still has that \"new store\" feel to it. Since then I've given them a good portion of my meager earnings. It's far and away a much better shopping environment than that disgusting, dated rat-hole across the street, Kmart. I wish they would just bulldoze that whole depressing shopping plaza already. Or any Kmart or Walmart for that matter. To me, possibly saving ten cents is not worth the hassle and horror of shopping in those places.\n\nThough the level of customer service has become inconsistent at best since opening, most items are easy to find or price check on your own and checkout is rarely that bad. Sale items are usually in stock and, like most Target, there's an abundance of hidden clearance gems on almost all display endcaps facing the walls.\n\nThough this isn't a Super Target, it does have a food section, including wine and refrigerated\/frozen items. There's also a pharmacy inside.\n\nThis has to be one of the more convenient Targets in Orlando. Parking is never that bad (the lot is pretty much only for Target patrons) and is even monitored by video cameras now. The Customer Service desk is right at the entrance and rarely has a line. Weekdays are the best time to go if you're looking to avoid a crowd.",

And the sausage - there were 6 or seven types to select from (I had them all).  I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of every thing I tried.\n\nFor a drink, I had the beer sampler - six 4oz pours - 3 house beers and 3 German imports.   I would suggest this.  But if you know what you like, then I would suggest getting a liter mug!  (yes, a liter!)\n\nI went to the buffet twice, small portions and had my beer.   I would have been fine, but then ... just one more trip to the buffet... fat and happy comes to mind...\n\nIt is nestled away in the middle of the German Village in Columbus.

How could there be an legitimate Japanese restaurant outside of Japan? Especially when we are talking about \"Ramen\"! I was totally wrong! Sapporo Ramen is the bomb! The broth is rich, flavorful and everything you ask for in a bowl of excellent ramen. If you are a big eater, make sure you order extra noddles and extra pork! It may not be up to par with ramen places in Japan, but if you are craving some Japanese noodles, this is unequivocally the place to go! The only drawback is that it is kind of far out there as it is located in Porter Square. They only accept cash, so make sure you bring some.

I work next door in a hotel and sometimes after getting off work, I like to have some dinner and a couple cold beers to unwind.  \n\nI have to say that something that could have been negative turned into an outstanding experience and has made me a regular and lifetime customer of Tavern In the Square in Burlington. \n\nOne night I was there and had a few beers.  When I went to leave, I was handed my card and I left without even looking at it.  Turns out someone with my same last name and same bank just happened to have a card there as well.  I didn't see until the next day.  I called them up and they informed me that they still had my card and the other person was actually at the bar right then.  So I went back and exchanged cards (after the manager checked our ID's).  \n\nThe bar staff was so friendly and helpful.  The manager comp'd me a meal for the trouble.  But the best part was that there were several creepy moments where strange men would approach me.  One even came over and ate my leftover french fries...and then complained to the staff that they weren't warm.  \n\nThis is where the amazing part comes in.  The manager walked me out and made sure that I got to my car safely to avoid the creeps.  Multiple times throughout the night, the bar staff checked on me to make sure that people weren't bothering me.  The bar staff were so friendly and careful to make sure that I was ok.  As a single woman who drinks alone often, this is my new favorite spot.  The overall care and safety I feel when here is amazing.  The staff is wonderful and the food is great!",

Other than the sauerkraut, red cabbage and hot potato salad, there was literally nothing remotely German on the menu.

Having not been there for a number of years, I was very hopeful that I would be able to go to one on this visit. Sadly, the visit was short and I walked by their location by the Seaport but could not stop.\n\nBut I was pleased to see they had a location right across my gate at the airport. While they had a limited menu (and a full bar), I did find something to get. Their Lobster Roll was on special but did not seem worth the cost. I ended up getting a Crabmeat Roll which came with chips and slaw. First of all, the slaw was outrageous. It had a slight sweetness to it, but a variety of crisp vegetables that made it unique. The bag of chips was rather small and I would have preferred potato salad or even fries. But the roll was really good - as I would expect from Legal.\n\nThe bar was very nice - crowded. I sat on a stool at the bar. While the seating was very tight - in fact anytime anyone moved all of the bar stools knocked together, the patrons were great. We all talked to each other and generally had a good time.",

Good atmosphere, some really fun items on the walls, and multiple giant screen televisions to stay on top of the latest games. Really appreciated the customer service from my server, Phoebe, who knew the menu, was extremely positive and professional, and could not have been better. Quick service, attention to detail.

When it does, you end up wondering around the city looking to satisfy that taste for popping fresh shrimp, clams, crab, Tuna, lobster and all the goodness that good seafood offers!\n\nIf you love fish, I recommend a type of fish called the unicorn. This fish has the most amazing texture and taste and is an upgrade to other fish! You can order the unicorn for your fish and chips for an upcharge and of course adding your usual malt vinegar and lemon completes the taste. All custom orders are welcomed by Chef Terrance as the most important objective is to have very satisfied customers! I ate there with my girlfriend the other night and \"I'll Be Back!\"",

I even dozed off for a little bit... \n\nAgain I loved the fact that no small talk had to take place...I know most are uncomfortable with silence but I LOVE it... I was able to drift off to daydream land happily....\n\nWhen she was finished we went to the mani station... I just needed a basic mani as my nails were recently destroyed to a bout of nail biting...don't judge people I did state I was under a lot of stress....\n\nWhen she was finished my nails looked salvageable... And that makes me happy! \n\nA special for a reg mani and deluxe Pedi is $45.... NYC I would think you were crazy... Florida that's about right.....\n\nSo for now I have found my weekly mani place as its only $12 and Ashley was fantastic! \n\nScore another point for Orlando.... Not to bad Orlando...

Nigerians frequent this restaurant as well, which always a good sign.\n\nA friend and I went here on a Friday night at around 7:30pm. I was excited about breaking the Daniel Fast (a diet consisting of vegetables, fruits, rice and potatoes). I ordered the jolof rice, plaintains, beef suya, and goat meat. The beef was a little rough for my taste, because as an American, I just wasn't used to it.\n\nI can't wait to come back. Next time, however, I'll come during the day.

Hummus? Tahini? Yogurt sauce? Anything? These 4 extremely underseasoned meatballs came with nothing. There was 4 pieces of pita bread as well.

Touring some of the wealthier streets of the Alphabet District builds up to the atmosphere of the Pittock Mansion.\n\nIf you don't want to spend the $10 admission fee, at least come here to tour the grounds.

UGH!!! My husband told me to move around her, but there were 4 of us and I figured that would be kinda rude. I guess the jokes on me.\n\nI wasn't terribly impressed with the soups. There were a lot of them, but I really only had a desire to try 2 of them. I sampled the tomato soup and the clam chowder. The chowder was simply ok, I didn't really care for the tomato soup at all. It was just missing something, maybe that sweetness that I enjoy in my tomato soup. I don't know, I just found it to be very boring. The chowder was creamy and nice, I added bacon to mine which brought up the salt level.\n\nThe breads were delish. They had a macaroni and cheese bread that I thought was fantastic and clever. The bread didn't have macaroni on it, but it did have cheese and the cracker crumble that homemade macaroni and cheese has, and lots of it. It was this crunchy, salty, cheesy, soft breaded goodness that is such a unique combo that I fell in love with it on the spot.\n\nI have to mention that I got a baked sweet potato and that poor little thing had been charred to a crisp. The foil and the bottom of the potato were blackened and it ruined the whole potato. Sad. I shall mourn that poor little sweet potato.... it was so young, take me instead!!!!\n\nThe dessert options left me wanting. I didn't care for much of any of it. The \"ice cream\" tasted more like ice milk, the brownie was sitting in this sauce that tasted thin and non fatty. I get it, it's healthy. Healthy desserts suck. That wasn't a brownie, it was a frownie. It made me frown.\n\nOverall, the place was clean and the salad bar had lots of options. If you are in to the whole health scene, this is the place for you. I'm waiting for Cracker Barrel to open up a buffet place, so you can just guess where I fall on the whole healthy subject. \n\nMy biggest complaint was the entry set up, needing to drag my purse along the salad bar (it was a weird set up) before even getting to just be seated. I did NOT like that. Additionally getting stuck behind that woman who was trying to multitask and would not step aside, my issue here was the employees that LET her do this. If you want to donate to her cause, awesome, take a break and go talk to her... OUT of the line. Hungry Teri is a GRUMPY Teri.",

       "text":"Papi's serves authentic Cuban cuisine and is a happening place on the weekends.  Every time I've stepped in for lunch, the restaurant is hustling and bustling.  Papi's is located on the corner of Ponce and Myrtle, right next to Mary Mac's.  The restaurant has two entrances: one on the upper level on Ponce and one on the lower level\/side of the building on Myrtle.  There's a small parking lot in the back, which can get crowded quick.  If it's packed, street parking is available on Myrtle.  The restaurant is cozy and multi-leveled.  I've eaten both upstairs near the main entrance and downstairs where the bar and tables are located.  It's fun to sit at the window and watch the people and cars go by on Ponce.\n\nMy two favorite items at Papi's are their classic Cuban sandwich and the ropa vieja (Cuban shredded beef).  The sandwiches are big, the pork inside is smokey, and the bread is buttery and crispy.  All in all, it makes for a solid Cuban.  The ropa vieja is chewy, tender, and succulent because of all the sauce it's soaked up.  Typical side items I order include black beans and rice, maduros (sweet fried plantains), and yuca fries (all yummy).  Maduros are probably my favorite Cuban side.  The yuca fries are pretty thick.  The portions are filling and the prices are reasonable.  Friendly service too.",

       "text":"I have been to The Posh Spot a few times whenever I want to schedule some 'me time'. My first experience was a manicure and pedicure with a facial a few years ago. Today I went to my Brazilian wax appointment and my esthetician was Cameron. \n   Cameron is AWESOME! I agree with one of the other Yelpers who left a review saying that she couldn't recommend her enough. I believe Cameron is the only person who does waxing here, but I've also scheduled facials with her as well. I love how she asks you about your skin and explains which products she's going to use on you and how it'll benefit your skin. Towards the end of your facial, you get a mini neck and shoulder massage that feels great. Every time she does my facials, my skin looks refreshed and rejuvenated. \n   As far as Brazilian waxing , Cameron is the only person I trust to do it. No matter which side of town I live on, I always go back to her. My very first experience at some spot in Marietta a few years ago was horrible, so to have someone like Cameron be thorough and calming is a relief. She's also funny, too, as we talk about everything from reality tv shows to music to sports. Helps you not think too much of the pain of waxing, lol. \n    I've had a manicure and pedicure here before, as well as a massage. Honestly, after a few days the nail polish started chipping. I'll stick to Glam Nails on Paces Ferry near The Posh Spot for manicures and pedicures. As for the massage that I got a few months ago, Rebekah was good. Make sure to tell the masseuse how hard or how soft to go before they get started, though. \n    If I had to give a con, it would be that at times, you can hear the talking of the other patrons in the building while getting massages or facials, etc, in the separate rooms. Nothing annoying or anything that could completely take away from your relaxation, though. \n    I can honestly say that this is a great place to visit. It's affordable, provides a nice atmosphere, and the ladies working there are professional and friendly. \n\n\n#Yelp100",

       "text":"I like TT's for a venue its size because there is some variety to the layout. You can watch the band in front of the stage, where a raised ceiling has greatly improved upon the old sight lines. You can duck into the small lounge room on the side of the performance area. You can leave that part entirely and chat over on the other side of the U-shaped bar, if you need a break. Or you can shoot pool at a couple of tables far enough to hear yourself think but still within earshot of the bands.\r\n\r\nI'm not always interested in every band in a show, so this works nicely for me.\r\n\r\nTT's has music almost every night but is never open during the day unless there's a show, which is a shame because I'd drop in there over a lot of local bars. Still, it's a nice place to see a show. Tix are almost never more than $10, and it's a favorite of a lot of national acts who could fill larger rooms but want to keep the intimacy that a smaller venue like TT's provides. Sound could be better, and beer could be a little cheaper, but it's a good all-around package.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out for the smaller acoustic shows set up on the unlikely little stage (you won't know it's a stage unless someone's playing on it) on the opposite side of the bar from the main stage. They're a fun change of pace.",

I still hoard bahama mamas (their spicy sausages) whenever I visit Columbus so that I have a supply to grill when I leave. That all being said, the actual dining experience has recently been less amazing.\n\nFirst, the setup. This is the oldest restaurant in Columbus and is famous for their german sausages. Typically when you come, you get the all-you can eat buffet which includes few sides (and good ones) along with access to all the different kinds of sausage. They also have cream puffs bigger than your fist that are to die for. My wife is from Columbus and this was one of the places we *always* went whenever we visited.\n\nWe had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and found out they have an amazing private event space upstairs with two room set up off a hallway made to look like a cobblestone street complete with street lamps. The set up the buffet in \"street\" and your guests can go help themselves as they see fit. It was amazing.\n\nThat all being said, the last few times we've been I've felt like the sausages in the buffet, while good, aren't as good as they are when I grill them at home. I don't know if they're boiling them instead of grilling them, or grilling on a metal hot plate instead of over fire, but it's just disappointing. Not that they aren't good--they still are--but they are not as good as they could and should be.\n\nStill, the ambiance is great, the sausages are good, the sides are great, there's even some local craft beer on tap now. So, you won't be disappointed, but it's no longer the shining star in our food out in Columbus that it once was.",

You can go at your own pace and there is a lot of variety in the classes (hills\/sprints\/other things I forget the names of haha). \n\nI take class once a week now and look forward to it every time which was surprising to me because I really don't like running. There's something about having someone tell me what to do vs running by myself where I typically will just give up and start walking. I normally attend Amanda's class, she is a fantastic coach, very encouraging and clear with her instructions. I'm sure all the other coaches are great too, I just attend Amanda's class because the time and day suit my schedule best.\n\nThe front desk staff are always super friendly. My first time visiting they gave me a quick tour of the place.\n\n100% recommend this place for all skill levels (some people who attend the classes are training for marathons!)",

Technically aimed at the under 5 crowd, this place is a godsend for parents and caregivers who just. cannot. be. inside. any. more. The structures are fine, but the real appeal is the massive quantity of push toys, ride-on toys, dump trucks, etc. There are even some activity seats for the really young crowd. The community seems to value having these items, so when some disappear after weather and children have taken their toll, new ones periodically appear. Watch your children \"practice\" sharing over the very best ones!\n\nGrab some coffee at JP Licks and head over here first thing in the morning. Or bring pizza from The Same Old Place for a lunch time gathering. Or head out around 11 am to hit the lunch buffet at Bukhara.

I was referred to him from a friend for some health issues, as I live in Houston, and found his approach refreshing and helpful. He is a true health and wellness practitioner, and is very thorough, professional, and pays close attention to detail. He tends to think outside the box, and makes the most of your healthcare dollars. I really like a lot of what he does in his practice which focuses on anti-aging, and his approach has a noticeable effect on skin wrinkles, joint discomfort, and energy. Better than botox! He is very familiar with the lack of energy many of us experience, which he calls 'energy poverty', and is wide spread. His lab tests do a great job detecting these issues, and then making corrections. If you want someone who sees the big picture, go see Dr Phil Sledz DC.",

I wouldn't call them the best noodles, the highest quality noodles, or the tastiest noodles, but I would call them the most reliable noodles. And that's why they're getting 4 out of 5 stars. \n\nSince I work super close to this cart, I stop by here a lot, as in more often than I would like to admit to you or myself. The noodles are really cheap- $6! and taste pretty good 100% of the time. I always order the pad kee mao, which I assume is a pretty popular menu item since it's on the \"Quick Order\" menu. Something I always look for in a good pad kee mao is durability in the noodle, crunch in the veggies, and a decent\/light sauce. The pad kee mao here has all these things, and honestly, for $6, the durability in the noodle is good enough to keep me coming back. Isn't it the worst when you order noodles and there are just little bits of noodles on your plate, and no actual whole noodle? Let's not even go there. \n\nThe people who work here are super nice and the service is pretty quick, even when it's 12:30pm on a Wednesday and the line is 15 khaki slacks deep. This place is no Baan Thai, but unfortunately for me, Baan Thai is pretty inconveniently located. So in the mean, I'll be stickin' with Lai Tai.",

       "text":"A very nice step up from Madras Pavilion which was a comfortable favorite for 18 years or so (in Houston first).  Going to Madras Pavilion was a fast trip for comfort food (read dosas).  This is a nice restaurant with some exquisite foods! The dosa was crispy, light and very flavorful (I got the Mysore dosa). The sauces with it were sublime. A creamy one that doused heat and refreshed the palate; one that was a thicker and creamer sambar than I'm used to but was very tasty. The third sauce with the dosa was a tomato based (I think) one that had a nuanced spice profile.  \n\nThe lamb vindaloo was fabulous too! Though in a different style than I've had before.  This had a vinegar base but still with the flavor and heat expected.  I suspect that vindaloo is a lot like our barbecue. You'll get a different thing in every region.  In this case, it is a winner and not one of those faux-barbecue-that's-interesting-but-let's-not-do-that-again varieties.  \n\nMy only complaint is one that I do not share with most folks, though my Babycakes agrees with me, Muttar Panir should generally have more peas than it typically does.  We love the sweetness of the peas with the spices in the sauce.  Too few peas and you just don't get that juxtaposition.  Now, my idea of enough peas is more peas than the sauce can drown!  So don't hold this complaint against Zaika!\n\nI will be back!  They have Indian style breakfast too y'all!! Iddly! Uttapams!  \n\nThe staff were attentive and appreciative of our enjoyment of the food.  \n\nThe menu notes which items are strictly vegetarian and which ones are gluten free.  I know there are those who are unhappy that this is no longer a strict vegetarian place.  There are likely those like me who did not get to eat there as often as they liked because the carnivores we love didn't want to go there. Now we can each get what we like!\n\nI'm looking forward to trying dessert next time. I ate too much this time for any ras malai!",

Granted I was there for the buffet and didn't expect the kind of service had I ordered off the menu.  What I got however, was lacking.\n\nAfter walking in the door, the first thing I was met with when I went to the hostess' stand was the hostess with her back to me talking on and on to another employee about something personal going on in her love life.  When she finally turned around, she wasn't apologetic or acted particularly interested in seating me. \n\nOnce seated I waited for an inordinately long time before a waitress came over to take my order.  I didn't find the buffet on the menu and had to ask her about it.  So I'm getting and refilling my food, no big deal; however, my drink was never re-filled nor did she ever come over to ask if everything was alright.\n\nThen the waitress gets my dessert order wrong.  On the way to get the correct dessert, she stops and talks to the table next to me filled with three clamorous older women who were having issues....meanwhile, my dessert was melting.\n\nThen after getting some take-out from the front counter, the clerk couldn't make change correctly for a simple order.\n\nI attribute this all to hiring inexperienced staff and not training them properly.  Like I said, my meal at Schmidt's would have been much better with better service.\n\nThe food was good, and I'll be back.  I saw more experienced wait staff there so I'm sure my second trip there will be better.\n\nA side note about the three clamorous older women......While gorging themselves on the buffet, I heard all about their medicare problems, hip replacements, and vision insurance.  Once they finished with the main course(s), they ordered desserts and had them put in to-go containers, telling our waitress that they'd only eat half of them in the restaurant and take the rest home.  Ok, no problem.....until they ate the whole dessert and then filled up their to-go containers with food from the buffet.\n\nIt was certainly a memorable meal!",

It was a fun place! \nThe food was yummy, esp. the bahama mama!!! \nWe had the PBJ cream puff, it was ok though. The cream puff was a bit on the soggy side. It's more of PB than jam taste since they drizzled the jam for decoration on the PB cream.\n\nI guess the service was ok for a bar\/causal dining, the waitress was friendly, so I am sure she didn't mean it when she literally just \"dropped\" off the glasses\/mugs on the table.",

I thought I should get it aligned after changing out the tie rods. In short, they \"aligned it\" but now it drifts to the right.  The steering wheel visibly turns right if you let go.  I took it back in for them to look at again, especially since I didn't think it did that before we started aligning it.  They took a quick look then a mechanic came out to basically tell me there is nothing wrong with.  I told him its pulling to the right.  He condescendingly told me that they drive these cars before they work on them and that it was pulling to the right before I brought it in.  He was really rude and unhelpful.  He seemed to think I was trying to cheat the shop by asking that my car drive straight down the street after being aligned by professionals.  This is an ALIGNMENT shop....

The broth had a hint of sweet\/sour taste to it...so delicious and it wasn't spicy (that I like). They provided free prepackaged chili sauce if you wanted to kick it up a notch. My soup was perfect the way it was served.\n\nI also purchased five pot stickers for $3. They were cooked perfectly, soft with a slight crunchy texture with seasoned port meat inside. It came with a blend of soy and vinegar dipping sauce, which was a perfect pairing with pot stickers. \n\nOverall, this food from Lai Thai Food Cart was absolutely delicious and worth every penny. I only had to wait maybe five-eight minutes and it was served fresh and hot. Great customer service and they accept credit card. - And as you can see, it was very inexpensive but top-notch!  \n\nSee attached photos and let me know if you like the review.",

I had the worst nail salon experience in my entire life here. \n\nI needed to get my acrylic nails removed and my usual nail salon was super busy and I wouldn't have made it there before they closed. I decided I would look for something closer and found this place. Even though some of the reviews weren't good there were a couple that claimed this place had really great service so I went for it. \n\nThe place looks like a utility closet that has a bunch of trash and useless items stuffed into random areas. The store is small and there's an upstairs area with more pedi stations. This may be okay for some people and that's fine. I personally go to the nail salon to relax and feel pampered. This is not the place for you if you feel the same. I gave them the benefit of the doubt despite their appearance. \n\nThe woman who removed my acrylics did a good job doing just that. All I wanted my nails painted after that. She started shaping my real nails (I kept the length) without even asking me how I liked them. She made them into an oval slanted shape. It looked so stupid! I held my hands out to look and my nails were literally turning left. Wtf! She ruined two fingers before I saw how dumb it looked so I had to file down my whole hand just to make it look decent and match. Even before then when I was trying to give her suggestions on how I wanted it and she didn't listen to what I was saying, so I politely asked to do it myself. I do not like doing that because it's kind of insulting to the nail tech and it defeats the purpose of why I'm there but I had to! After that she had an attitude with me. She got paint all over my cuticles, barely cut them down or scraped off any excess on my nail bed. I left unhappy and then realized I shouldn't have to pay for something I don't like. \nI returned 5 mins later and asked for a partial refund. Ugh. Long story short she gave me a partial refund by throwing money at me, argued, swore and yelled at me. If I could give 0 stars I would. NEVER AGAIN. NEVER.",

The office is full of intelligent, interesting, and happy people. Don't bother going anywhere else, even for a quote. You'll only be wasting valuable time. Dr. K could be fixing up your smile right this second!! Hop to it. \n\nAs far as the nitty gritty details - the office is beautifully designed, if you ever have any issues they will find a way to fit you in post haste, and I always seem to score exactly the appointment times that work within the confines of my busy schedule. \n\nAs an adult with braces, I can only speak to my experience and not that of children - but I do see happy kids there every visit! (And if you're an adult considering braces, but are on the fence, DO IT! You'll look cute. Swear.)\n\nIt's worth mentioning that I had an issue with my gums for which I had to see a specialist, and Dr. K and team assisted me throughout the entire process. No matter what goes down, he is involved and he stays involved to make sure you are well taken care of. I've never seen any doctor go so above and beyond what one could reasonably expect.\n\nA final point: they care, they really, really care, about the quality of your smile. They won't cut corners. If you mean serious business about your teeth, this is the only place in Atlanta you need to be. Make it happen.",

Note that sometimes they will run out of ingredients used in baos that are not used in other menu items, so be wary ordering certain types of baos (mango salmon is the one that has given me trouble) close to when they close.  \n\nThe entrees are fine as well, but not up to the same quality as the baos.  I order them fairly frequently, though, for the huge portion sizes and low prices.  The marinated rice plates come with two big meals' worth of meat, rice, and \"aioli\" sauce, plus a salad, french fries, and dumplings.  With some spicy sauce, these plates can be quite good.  The stir-frys and \"house specials\" are alright.  Everything is a great value for the quantity of food -- $8-$10 for everything.  \n\nThe hostess is always very nice and provides great service whether you're eating in or taking out.",

I had an outstanding, thick cuppa chowda-- filled with tender clams infused with rich seafood flavor-- and fantastic crisp fried clams (about $20+ for the platter, which our server said came with more clams than the cheaper appetizer).  These were light years better from the frozen Arthur Treacher rubbery strips I grew up with; breaded fresh large clams, tender and so plump beneath the thin crispy coating, that some could've been mistaken for fried oysters.  The place is on the pricier side for my  typical airport meal, but seemed justified for the quality and portion sizes.  When your stuck in BOS airport and need some quality food, this place has it.

I came here on Memorial Day evening after the actual mansion had already closed, and it's actually worth the short drive up the hill just to walk around (and it's free, parking is free!)\n\nPros:\n- cute touristy very PORTLAND spot - you can come chill for about 30 minutes, take in the view of Portland (which isn't bad! see pics), walk around the house, take pictures in front of the beautiful mansion, etc.\n- Benches and places to sit around the house if you're coming up here for some alone time, journal, pray, people watch, etc.\n- REALLY GREAT FLOWERS! - they look beautiful, there's always bees pollinating them, if you need a cute background for headshots, etc. (honestly, there's probably better flowers here than most greenhouses\/ arboretums, etc.) Really therapeutic place to feast your eyes and take in some plant views\n- super peaceful vibes - people are always chilling, hanging out with friends, walking their dogs here, etc.\n- you get to read these plaques about the Pittocks, Portland history, etc. (all for free, because they're outside the mansion)\n\nCons:\n- the gender neutral bathrooms at the entrance of the mansion are NASTY AF. It literally smelled like feces and urine, there was toilet paper all over the floor. I'm not sure what could possibly happen at the Pittock Mansion that would result in this atrocity, but you have been warned.",

I got the Kubideh kabob (mix of ground beef and lamb) on top of salad and a side of the Maste Khiar, a yogurt based cucumber sauce. \n\nThe kabob was fantastic, amazingly tender and juicy with well balanced seasoning.  Rightfully the star of the meal.  The salad was also excellent, with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and feta cheese under an oil based dressing.  The Maste Khiar rounded out the meal well, balancing the richness of the meat with creamy tangy goodness.\n\nValue for the quality and portion size of the meal was good.  Victor mentioned that he also does house made Doner Kabob on Wednesdays and a rotating special on Mondays.  With that in mind, this certainly won't be my last visit.",

Obviously, the more people there are, the harder it would be for the workers to keep up with the mess, particularly during holidays. We came here once for Mother's day and it was packed with a long line of customers stretching to the parking lot. It took us over 15 minutes just to get inside the door. There were food and used napkins all over the floor. If you don't like chaotic scenarios, I would recommend avoiding coming here during the holidays. Otherwise, this place actually received a Sanitation Inspection grade of A from the City of Boston. Impressive, especially for a buffet. \n\nThere is a tremendous variety of comfort Chinese and American foods from appetizers, entrees, snacks, healthy options and dessert. The food is tasty, fresh and well stocked. The have a hibachi grill in the back and AYCE crab for dinner on weekends. The price is ridiculously inexpensive for the unlimited feast to chow down on. \n\nI love that the bathrooms are decent and well ventilated, so one can comfortably relieve himself\/herself.

I actually got a chance to speak with Victor and he told me the story of how he ended up in Portland a couple of years ago from NYC...very nice guy and passionate about what he does.\nI ordered the Kubedeh Kabob (seasoned ground beef and lamb in a pita with yogurt sauce along with lettuce, tomatoes and onions) as it seemed pretty popular. I watched him make it and he seasoned the hell out of that meat as the flavor was off the meat rack! It seemed as he put too many ingredients in the kabob and that I would need to eat with a fork as I thought it would fall apart as I ate...I was wrong as he wrapped it to perfection and I had no trouble devouring the kabob.

There were some perks,  of course, like discovering an awesome golf course with miniature golf right smack in the middle of a gargantuan course. The miniature golf course is exactly what the name implies: a miniature golf course. There's no windmills, no clowns, no blinking lights. It's a miniature version of a full-sized golf course with sand traps and hazards set by a babbling brook. It's gorgeous. The course faces west, which makes sunset play time amazing. I've played at Eagle Landing several times and never really encountered many other people making it a serene destination to flaunt your competitive edge and catch up with a friend. \n\nIf you're ok stepping out of Portland for a hot second then I recommend taking in 18 miniature golf holes. You may have so much fun that you'll want to do the second course. Wait, TWO 18 hole miniature golf courses?! You read me right. Maybe leaving the Portland bubble isn't as bad as everyone claims.",

It'll be hard to pass up the potato salad, rice and mac & cheese but these starches will take up too much room in your stomach that should be reserved for the delicious sausages. Sample each one saving just enough space for saurkraut and red cabbage. The garlic Knockwurst and their famous Bahama Mama (weird name) are awesome as is the sausage stew.

       "text":"My husband and I met up for a much needed dinner date.  I ordered the veggie burger (one of only a couple vegetarian meal options) and my husband ordered his steak tips medium cooked.  \n\nThe steak came mostly black, and my veggie burger... well, I'm just going to add a picture and you can tell ME what you think it looks like.  Needless to say, it's the first time I've ever gagged on a bite and spit it out.  I focused on my fries since clearly the veggie burger was out of the question.\n\nOh, but that's not the worst part.  We were sitting outside on the patio on a BEAUTIFUL, cool summer day, and we suddenly noticed fluid sprinkling down.  A seagull had perched above us on the building and was secreting copious amounts of fluid on us.  It spewed repeatedly on our food, in our drinks and all over my husband.  We ducked to another table, appetites lost (as if they were there anyway after we saw the food) and explained to the manager what happened.\n\nThe waitstaff and manager saw the bird in action and brought us another drink each.  Then they brought us the check.  They took off one of my beers and the veggie burger, but we had to argue my husband's seagull-filled meal off the bill.  We ended up paying for our drinks and appetizer, but in the interest of customer relations, I'd have offered the customer a free meal.  We felt sick after that.\n\nSo go ahead and eat there, but only if you're fond of seagull vomit and management who doesn't know how to cater to customers.  Hopefully my appetite will return in a few days.",

       "text":"here's my letter to Verizon customer service\n\n\nVerizon Wireless\nCorrespondence\nP.O. Box 291089\nColumbia, SC 29229\n\n\nToday one of your salespeople at the Happy Valley Sunnyside Road franchise did about a thousand dollars worth of damage to your good will with me.\n\nI have an old Alias 2 phone and it's been dropping calls. The sales rep at the Happy Valley, Oregon store told me it was because my phone was so old.\nI accept that.\nShe said \"You qualify for an upgrade.\" And showed me the tired looking flip phone you have, but said it will drop fewer calls and since I'm electrosensitive and I don't want a smart phone I asked how much it was.\n\"It'll cost you about eighty dollars.\"\nOkay, for once I decided I wouldn't waste time shopping around. It was a Verizon store, right? And Verizon cares about their image.\n\nAt the end she pulls out a little contract and suddenly it's nine dollars a month for 24 months and I said \"you said it would be eighty dollars\".\n\"Oh, that's just for the start-up\".\nI didn't know if there were even more charges, taxes, other fees she'd forgotten to mention...but I said 'just forget it.'\nI had to stand around a few minutes while she called a manager somewhere to undo whatever she'd done, though I hadn't signed anything yet.\n\nAs I was leaving, I believe I heard her saying to her manager on the phone \"And I didn't even get an apology.\"\nI turned around and said: \"Are you saying I didn't apologize to you, because if anyone should get an apology, it's me from you.\"\nShe said \"Oh, no I wasn't saying that.\"\n\nNow, I was teed off about my time wasted and what I consider a bait and switch sales pitch...so I will accept that maybe she was apologizing to the sales manager.\nAnd maybe I was wrong about that.\nBut I did not yell. And she should have apologized for her cheesy sales b.s.\n\nAnd when I went outside my phone didn't work, so I went back in and told her and she said: \"Oh, it will take about twenty to thirty minutes for your account to come back up.\"\n\nWas it my intuition? I can tell you I would have bet five to one my phone account wouldn't be up two hours later (it wasn't) nor the next morning (it wasn't't). Got it reinstated....tech support told me my account info had not been entered so it never would have come back on line without my calling them.\n\n\nIs this the latest Verizon company wide sales policy? I'm hoping just this one salesperson at this one Verizon store. Because you can imagine how positive a picture I'm going to paint of Verizon when friends are discussing what carrier to use.\n\nIf \"you qualify for an upgrade\" means \"you get to buy this phone for a lot more than I'm initially going to lead you to believe, i.e. monthly charges you don't have now.....\", then doesn't any human adult on the planet\nwith a credit card qualify for an upgrade and a sleazy sales technique?  \n\nBy the way, the tech person told me I could buy the same phone from Verizon or even on ebay, and there's be no new monthly fee. So how many ways was this person (in my opinion) possibly trying to cheat me?\nMaybe not at all, for all I know she made a mistake on sales presentation, made a mistake on monthly fee that was not needed, made a mistake re not reinstating my phone service.\n\nEither way......a disaster.\n\nVery Ticked Off at Verizon,",

My husband was at another store in the same shopping plaza so I told them to go ahead and do it.\nWhen we went to the pedicure chairs my 4yr old had to use the restroom before sitting so I walked her back and there was someone occupying the restroom. The guy who was assigned to do her nails came up and started knocking on the door and when the person still didn't come out he asked me if I would like to take her out the back door so she could \"go\" outside.   YES. You read that right.  I said \"WHAT?!\" With a disgusted look on my face and he said \"nothing, never mind\" and walked away. Two minutes later the person came out,she used the restroom and sat in the pedi seat.\n As they were getting started My husband called and asked how it was going.. I told him that they're just starting but we're never coming back because of how outrageously they charge and how appalled I was about being asked to take our daughter outside like a dog to go pee. He asked for more clarification so I started about the $88 and he stopped me right there. Apparently this was the same place he took them a month ago and got them child mani\/pedi with gel for $55 each.\nI told him he needed to come here and straighten it out because I was fed up with the place already. Then I asked my 10yr old for confirmation that this was the exact location and exact service they did when Daddy took them here. She confirmed.\nThen the same lady says to me that she overheard my conversation and \"we don't change our prices here, y'know what I'm sayin?\" And I said \"no, I don't know what you're saying because when you get charged $55 one time and $88 another it seems a lot like changing prices. If you don't remember it my husband is on his way and he'll show you the billing statement that shows exactly how much he paid that day.\" \nHer response was \"Listen, we don't want you to be unhappy with our service so we can just finish taking their prior gel off and you can go to any other nail salon over here that does it cheaper\"\nI said \"It's not the service I'm unhappy about because No service has been done yet. I'm unhappy about being charged a different price than before and this guy asking me if I'd like to take my daughter out the back door to use the restroom. So what you should do is charge appropriately, finish the job so we can pay and never come back.\" \nShe said \"we don't do things like that here y'know what I'm sayin? So it would be best if we just take their gel off and you can go. And the thing with him was a miscommunication.\" rrright, because she was there and all..\nSo I said \"oh okay, I see. That's fine.\" I called a salon nearby and made a walk-in appointment arriving in  the next 5 min and told her employees they didn't have to bother taking their gel off, thank you.\nFYI the other salon was down the street charged $60 each, offered us beverages upon arrival and did a fantastic job! It's called YOU Nail Salon and Spa.\n\nSo before you consider this establishment with horrid people..just don't. Save yourself a nauseating experience and get treated fairly while you pamper yourself elsewhere.",

Both were good experiences so I thought I'd try the venue in Burlington when I needed to meet my Dad who was in from out of town, for a beer & bite to eat at a place that was open after 10pm on a weeknight (as not many places are ANYWHERE outside the city).\n\nGot there around 930pm, the bar half was pretty crowded with VERY loud music. We sat in a booth parallel to the bar on the restaurant side. We weren't even acknowledged until at least 20 minutes after sitting down. We made eye contact with several servers walking by who were taking care of ONE group next to us and...nothing.  Finally, our order was taken (didn't need anymore time to decide, 20 mins was good enough). The beer my Dad chose: the keg was tapped, not a big deal - it happens - we love beer, he found another. The beer I ordered: the pint glass was handed to me only full up to at least an inch below the rim...no head. Never seen that before...\n\nTomato soup - great.  Mixed salad with goat cheese, walnuts & apples: rough. \n\nOverall would not recommend this Tavern location for food at all. BUT the bar side looked fun for a Thursday night, lots of TV's - so if I was in the area, I'd give it a try for just drinks at least once.",

Classic, old-school, greasy-spoon...whatever you call it, this is the place to go if you are looking for a hearty breakfast. This is the type of place where you walk out smelling like grease. Oh yeah!!! Good food, good portions at reasonable prices. Highly recommend for a weekend breakfast. Go early since seating is very limited. Also, if you drive there, park on Hancock. They have only 3 or 4 spots in front of the diner. They also have takeout!",

It was my first time in that little plaza, and it made me want to try out all the other cute little places to eat sometime. It was actually a pretty long wait since we went on a friday night, at least 30 min if not close to an hour for a party of 5. It's also a very small place, so it makes sense. Again, waiting indoors in the plaza made the wait really easy. I got the house ramen. The broth is definitely the absolute best part. the noodles were also quite satisfying. if only their meat was better, then they would beat out places like yume wo katare. They were just very ordinary meat chunks, as opposed to great ramen places which have melt in your mouth slices of pork belly and other such delectables. Also the eggs were just boring hardboiled eggs.",

       "text":"I borrowed a car for a few months and if I've learned one thing, it's that cars are *expensive*. I was super happy to find Tire Town for their super reasonable prices. \n\nExperience one: I had a flat tire on worn out summer tires, and I tried to come here, though they weren't open (it was 8:57 and their sign said 9am, but the random guy sitting in their parking lot told me they were opening at 9:30). So I took it down to another place on Clark, which plugged my tire for a few days. 0 stars. \n\nExperience two: I returned to have the winter tires put on. It was the cheapest place I found ($30!!!). No appointment necessary! I dropped off the car and came back after a wee VV shop, and the car was ready. Hooray! Eleventy billion stars! \n\nExperience three: even though I had asked them during experience two to check out the winter tires since one of them had a slow leak,  they clearly didn't, since a few days later I had a flat tire. When I took the car back to see if this tire could be repaired, they told me that the nail (cause of slow leak) had destroyed the sidewall and therefore the tire was shot. So sad! And then they charged me money to put my tire back on. 0 stars. \n\nSo, lesson learned: Not extremely impressive service, but very reasonable prices. I would suggest being very assertive with what you want. All in all, I'm just happy I don't have a car anymore.",

I was accustomed to getting decent ramen back in San Diego where there was a bigger Asian population; however, this place has got to have the best ramen i've ever had. I highly recommend the spicy miso ramen...don't worry folks, it is not spicy at all...just really flavorful. One could argue that it's from the MSG, but I would like to think that it's from the 10 hours of brewing as advertised. I like the fact that it's one of the hidden treasures of Porter Square but the reason why I give it a minus star is because of two reasons. First, they are always really crowded and what kills me is that they aren't very efficient with their space...they could easily fit in another table that could seat 4 extra people. I know that their space is limited but they need to be more efficient...It's really annoying waiting forever knowing that they have space for more people. My second complaint is that they serve you water straight from the tap. I'm usually ok with this, but I had stuff floating around in my water and it's a turn off (I usually bring my own water now). Bottom line, food here is amazing, definitely worth a try.",

We narrowed down our choices, but said that we needed to come back another day and get a better feeling for the mattresses.  The second time we came back we were greeted by Jason who was also very patient, engaging and knowledgeable.  Jesse had made him aware that we may be returning to try out the mattresses again.  They worked as a team and obviously supported each other.  We chose our mattress on our second visit and had it delivered the same week.  The gentlemen who delivered the mattress called the morning of delivery to let us know what our 2 hour window was.  I asked that they call 20 minutes before arriving and they obliged.  They too were professional and very efficient - they were in and out of the house in a flash!  Have not seen anyone work so quickly in a long, long time.

Very friendly staff and super calm, peaceful, chill doctor made this such a great experience that I came back to remove two of my wisdom teeth a few weeks later. My case, being more difficult being that I am older, have trouble with anesthesia and nitrous, I had to go at it awake and anxious! However Dr. Clark educated me on exactly what to expect and calmly talked through every step as he went along. He and his assistant also gave nice encouragements along the way. The procedure was so quick and easy that I was shocked to find it over in about 15 minutes, not much different from some dental procedures I've had. Even gave a follow up call and left his personal number if I had any questions. I've had such sub par to awful experiences with other oral surgeons that this experience went well beyond all expectations. Trust me, trust them.",

       "text":"I spotted the \"Grand Opening\" sign for Lucky Bistro one day while driving home to Sherwood, the item that really got me going was Dim Sum.  This my friend was my lucky day.  Could it be, great or even good Dim Sum this close to home?  The short answer is yes, not just good but some of the best I've had from Beaverton to the Far East Side of Pea Town, for you see I don't just like the stuff I crave it, I need it, I quest for it.  Now don't get me wrong, Lucky B has it all, not just DS.  A full menu of Chinese delights of which I plan on working my way though after spotting some wonderful looking dishes being received by a large party at a table next to ours.  The menus has a nice balance of Appetizers, soups, porridges, noodle in soup, noodle \/rice noodle, fried rice, chicken, pork, beef, vegetable\/ tofu, ceramic pot, sizzling,  Szechuan and seafood.  Did I miss anything? I say not.  A lounge and a large private area plus I'm sure takeout round out Lucky B's amenities.  As I said, this day was for Dim Sum so here's the story.  They do the cart thing plus small trays of hot goodies direct from the kitchen all morning up to 3pm, from then on till 8pm one may order these heavenly delights from a menu of 38 items.  They say a picture is worth a 1000 words so look to the photos for what we had.  The stand outs where, Deep Fried Lobster Roll, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, Baked Cream Yellow Bun, Egg Tart and Ham Sui Kok.  The tea was hot, the selection of condiments on the table was good and the staff friendly.  Good parking lot, a new and clean joint and serving seven days a week, what more could a person want.

He told me it could be fixed without putting another shank on it.  I was told I would receive a call when It was ready.  That call did not come so I followed up with them and picked it up.  After a few months, the fit was loose and there was entirely too much play in the shank.  I took it back to Hays and he agreed and said they would fix it again.  I received a call when it was ready; to my dismay, it was exactly in the same condition as when I dropped it off a few days earlier.  When I questioned Walter's wife why it was not checked for a tight fit prior to picking it up, she got defensive with me.  Hays then came out and took full responsibility for the situation and promised they would make it right, which I thanked him for doing.  I then received a call later that day from his father, Walter, who was a total jerk on the phone with me and started to disparage the shank and how it was not done correctly to begin with, etc. He said he would speak to the jeweler and to give him 24 hours. He called and said the ring was ready to be picked up without explaining what was done.  I had to ask and he was very short with me.  Upon picking up the ring,  a blonde lady waited on me and I told her I would probably need to speak with Hays, who saw me, nodded his head, and went back to working on the computer.  I then received an eye roll from the lady when I asked for documentation that there was a warranty of one year from the second time it was fixed.

       "text":"Honestly i just love their salad with chicke. It's always fresh. And their homemade dressing is awesome. just what i was looking for lunch. try it!\nAnd i recently i buy pizza and it was something. I couldn't stop myself becouse it was so good. I got a pizza with chicken, broccoli and alfredo sause. It was really good combination actually. I just ask the girl on register what kind of pizza is her favourite and she say this one. In their menu it's called nachek pizza and u getting chooice of white sause: alfredo or ricota cheese. \nIf u have some questions or u don't know what to get go and ask the girls on register they always nice and give u good advise. \nThe slice bar has big choice. And it's very good actually. If u not feeling like buying whole pizza u can just get scile of the day. \nAnd i went in evening recently and they have life music. That was fun. The group name was LOOSE CHANCE i believe. And they were good actually.  I like their idea about life music and also twise a month in saturday the piano man coming around 12 till 2 so u have nice lunch with life music. I believe it's a good place to spend time",

       "text":"I would really like to give this place a 3.5 or 4 Star review, but the service killed it... Seriously! I was excited about all the hype I've been hearing about this German Restaurant in German Village, Columbus OH. The food was very good. Simple, original, traditional german food... \n\nWe went on a Monday night. According to Yelp and Google this place was supposed to be open till 10pm. We arrived at 8pm and were seated right away! The server was very \"cold\" and had somewhat of an attitude from the beginning: she was really \"in a hurry\" to take our order, didn't take time to explain the menu or anything at all, although we did mention it was our first time there... In a few minutes the place kind of filled up, and her attitude just continued to be bad or even worse...\n\nAfter some good recommendations from the people sitting next to us, we ordered our food and it came pretty fast. I had the German Sausage Sample Plate with 4 kinds of house made sausage including their famous Bahama Mama, sauerkraut, german potato salad, chunky apple sauce and toast. Food was delicious. My girlfriend had the German Meatloaf plate which was also delicious!\n\nThe Cream Puff had to be \"To Go\" since we were stuffed, but that was a Bad Ass 1\/2 pound Cream Puff! \n\nAgain, the server then stated in a somewhat apologetic way at the end that they were \"short staffed since it was a Monday night and it was cold out and they sent some staff home early since they didn't expect it to get busy that night\"... Again, this is a popular, well-known place in German Village, with good reviews and plenty of good advertised food on numerous Food channels and websites. So how exactly did you \"not expect to be so busy!?\"  And again, it wasn't crazy busy, it was steady and she was just not very friendly. \n\nDo go try the food though!",

       "text":"Ohh myyy goodnessss. I am coming here from now on to get my rice, beans and maduros fix FO LYFE. Unless I move back to Miami ;)\n\nI tried their guava juice, papa rellena, the Friday lunch special which was ropa vieja, white rice, black beans, maduros, bread, and a little salad, and I ordered a medianoche sandwich to go. I can't express how delicious everything was! The portion was huge and it's CHEAP. Like, soo cheap. Not too salty, not too bland, seasoned to perfection. The rice was soft and fluffy, the beans were savory and the maduros were sweet and a little crispy on the outside from the frying. I'm not a big fan of papa rellena, but the boyfriend seemed to really like it. The medianoche sandwich - ugh, amazing.\n\nOnly 2 gripes - when we first got there, it was really crowded. The hostess told us she'd be right there and then disappeared for 10 minutes. People who arrived after us just grabbed any available seats since there was nobody helping us - that was unfair and shaved time off the 1 hour lunch break we have at work (we ended up taking an almost 2 hour lunch... but I'd say it was worth it.) Also, the guava juice tasted nothing like guava, it was this weird, sweet, generically fruity tasting pink juice with maybe a hint of guava flavor.\n\nI'm definitely coming back to try more of their dishes and croquetas!! But if I come for lunch, I'll take it to go :)",

       "text":"Done going to this place. Prices are decent, but the staff is so rude, especially the owner! Every time I have been in there they run at least 15min late for my scheduled appointment. My last appointment I had was so awful, and the last time I would ever go back. The lady did not even apologize for running 15min late and then completely starting rushing my nails. I had red nail polish on my nails prior and literally there was so much red left everywhere when she started filing them. On top of it she kept on getting up the whole time checking customers out during my scheduled appointment. I actually had to get up and leave in the middle of my appointment because I was going to be late for work and I could tell she was rushing my nails. I did not get one apology from the lady I saw or the owner. In addition, the owner was literally laughing and staring at me while speaking Vietnamese when I was leaving on my way out. So rude and not the proper way to treat a customer! Do not recommend going here.",

       "text":"This was the last time my family and I visit this establishment. This place offered some of the worst customer service I have experienced in a long time. \n\nAfter being seated in a booth with my wife, sleeping infant daughter, and mother-in-law, it took roughly 8-10 minutes for our waiter to stop by and gather our drink order. His excuse was that he was not our waiter, he was stopping by to help Allison? the waitress while she was busy. Okay, cool.\n\nSo he comes to drop off our drinks, by that time we're ready to order. He looks nervous and quickly bails out of the situation before we had time to say \"We're ready to order now.\"\n\nSo we're waiting and waiting, still no sign of this mystery waitress he told us about. So he comes back and takes our order. We were hungry and got some Calamari as an appetizer. \n\nI shrug off the long wait and give them the benefit of the doubt, that maybe they're understaffed and overwhelmed. Fine. 15 minutes later. no calamari, no mystery waitress, no service period.\n\nFinally our food arrives. Pizza for me. The ladies split the pork chops. OH! And there's that Calamari we ordered. It came with our meal. None of us even wanted it at that point. The whole point of an appetizer is to have it come out before the meal. \n\nHere's how Merriam-Webster's defines \"Appetizer\" : \n\n\"A small dish of food or a drink taken before a meal to stimulate one's appetite.\"\n\nAnyway, the pork chops were cold, as my mother-in-law had expected after having reportedly stared at her plate sitting on the Expo Counter for an inappropriate length of time. My pizza left a lot to be desired as well. Very doughy. As I picked up the first slice, I watched as all the cheese, sauce, and toppings slide off the doughy triangle like an avalanche. Pathetic. \n\nSensing our disappointment, the waiter stopped by and commented on how terrible my pizza looked and offered to get me another one. I respectfully declined his offer and stated that I'd rather it just be removed from the bill as I had lost my appetite. I mentioned the pork chops were cold too, so they warmed those up for us. \n\nThe manager came by to apologize for the pizza, but partially blamed my choice of toppings for the pizza falling apart. Seriously? Chicken, onions, and bell peppers?!\n\nWhile the manager is giving us a half-assed apology, our mystery waitress finally swings by to drop off our recently heated up pork chops. \n\nBy this time my sleeping infant daughter is fully awake and I guess she could feel the tension cause she was quite angry. I picked her up and walked her around the perimeter a couple times. I just had to get out of here. \n\nAnyway, the pizza was removed from the bill, and we were given free dessert. Still, it wasn't enough to leave me satisfied or forget how bad it was as I sit here and write this review days later. \n\ntl;dr this place sucks",

       "text":"Came here the other day to get my eyebrows threaded and I don't think I'll be coming back. \n\nI told the lady that I just wanted to clean up my brows and not make them thin. As she's waxing, the first thing I notice is how much it hurts. If you've ever gotten your eyebrows threaded you'd know it doesn't hurt as much as waxing and you usually don't feel the string gliding over your skin too much. But I felt every single movement very clearly.. to the point where I thought she cut me a couple times. (When I returned home, I did notice that she missed a couple hairs but they were untweezable due to how deep she went -- that could be a plus for some people).\n\nLooking at my brows now, they are SO thin. As a guy, you really don't want your brows thinned out, let alone a shape change. I specifically said that I didn't want my eyebrows thinned out and I'm actually really disappointed. The top of my left eyebrow is now significantly lower than the other. I should have known from how she starting threading before even looking at my brows. One is thinner than the other and it's horrible. I have a friend who went here a couple months ago who said the same thing. It's cheap, but she does whatever she wants and carelessly thins out your eyebrows. \n\nDo not come here unless you you bring a friend to make sure she is actually trying to do a good job.",

The desserts are all awesome and i love to make ice cream sundaes (where do you really get to do that anymore).  Expensive for brunch though--it's all you can eat but I do not eat enough to warrant the price.

Everything was done to the highest standards.  The hotel's manager, Jeffrey, was very apologetic about the missed days, and he and his staff have been very nice and accommodating.  He also offered to waive the resort fees because of our inconvenience and I consider this to be very generous. \nThe positives of our stay- the resort is very close to all the Disney properties as well as all shopping and eating  establishments.  The grounds are well-kept and the playground and pool a great place for my 4 year old twins to let off some steam.  The safe didn't work upon our arrival but was immediately replaced.  The internet wireless connectivity was consistently available and quick.

But in my sample size of various packages and other Asian restaurants, I have not had ramen better than this. \n\nHoly crap, it's cheap, AND it's delicious. Some folks have told me they don't like the noodle consistency, but if we're going for personal preference: if I've been prepping for a visit, I can clean out a bowl in 15 minutes (the size of a small trough) if I have to handle conversation while eating. [ambiance: a little weird. the venue is like, 3-4 long tables. You get tap water in a cup-- it's okay since your mission is to shovel ramen-- and there can be a line. Bring cash-- there's an ATM in the building, and they don't accept credit cards here]\n\nMy favorite is the kimchi ramen, but I've enjoyed miso with butter (unabashedly, I love butter and I love fat.). I pour a bunch of chili oil (from the ridonkulously adorable little cat condiment bowls), and go to town. Th kimchi ramen comes with sliced roasted pork, sprouts, corn, seaweed, hard boiled tea egg (and kimchi, naturally)-- I noticed some folks have had cold pork and egg. I haven't had that happen to me, but I somehow doubt that it would phase me if it did. The reality is, the broth is what keeps me coming back. Finding delicious broth is freaking hard around here, and I would drink this broth through a straw if I didn't think I would possibly pop my stomach from over consumption. I do really like runny eggs in my udon, but I've got no complaints about the tea egg here. \n\nAlso, make sure you check out the cat cartoons stenciled on the wall. Under each overly expressive cat (one is bursting into tears of joy), there's a phrase. \"Growl. mmm. that! try. OH! my god.\" While you're deep in ramen consumption, it almost makes sense. \n\nYes, my God. Try the ramen. If you don't like it, it's only about $8.50, so you won't be out much for your adventure.",

       "text":"If you follow my reviews, one of my favorite things is finding a place that smells divine. Being that most nail spas in Miami are either a hit or a miss, most of them are all about speed and however many clients they can squeeze into a days work. What separates this spa from them in the city is that they take their time to service you, their staff is super friendly, very clean and great decor and most importantly, they make you feel very welcomed. \n\nGo and look for my boy Tai. He's super cool and down to earth. He's a family man and is very detail oriented. What's better than that when it comes to your nails and pedicure? The Hubbs and I were on a mini-va-K and wanted to feel relaxed, kick it back and talk for a bit. Tai took very VERY good care of us. He offered us a glass of wine and turned on their super sized massage chairs while we looked at their menu of services. He highly suggested that we do their delux pedicure. We surely didn't regret it! The scented oils and moisturizing mud wrap left our feet feeling tingly and smelling so good for the rest of the day. The whole day and even into the evening. His French manicure free hand was pretty precise. I love people who take great pride in their work.  \n\nAnd let's not forget that they also take pride in their sanitation. Very clean environment. \n\nI wanted a manicure that lasted into the following weekend so he opted for the shellac or gel manicure. I've never done it before and was willing to try anything that will last longer than a week with these weak and thin nails of mine. \n\nThe conversation flowed all afternoon. It takes a guy with a broad knowledge of sports and fantasy football to keep the Hubbs entertained while I was being worked on. Tai is one guy that I will surely come to look for again when I'm in Orlando. Here I am 2 weeks later and am STILL hangin on to this shellac French manicure. I won't go any other way from now on. He's made a believer out of me. Even though it costs $45 to do, I think it's worth every darn penny cause my natural nails won't last even 5 days with a regular French job. \n\nTHANK YOU Tai. You make the spa very fun and entertaining. And your work is still being enjoyed here in the MIA :)",

       "text":"I'm not sure why other Yelpers are being so generous with this place...\n\nMany people's parents have told them \"If you can't say something nice, then don't say anything at all.\" Fortunately, I don't think I got that.  I don't get to tear a place a new one often, but this one deserves it.\n\nThat said, I have one nice thing to say: the rice was good.  Noah's is one of the normal, dime-a-dozen Middle Eastern food carts serving sub-par food. This one was fairly egregious in its pricing and dubious quality.\n\nWe ordered from pictures, which included gyros sandwiches, lamb gyros, chicken shwarma, blah blah blah.  We ordered the \"lamb\" shwarma and chicken shwarma plates, each for $8 ($9 for dinner if you're really set on being screwed or you're desperately drunk, which is probably more accurate). We also ordered the $2 samusas, but they were \"sold out.\"\n\nWe watched our attendant cook form-fitted \"lamb\" meat, rectangular and perfect in size, and put it on a flat griddle. He then used tongs and puts some diced, marinated chicken meat on the griddle. We were not impressed.\n\nWhile that was cooking, he gooped in tzakiki and \"hummus.\" As we took our plastic tubs to our eating place in the park, complete with plastic forks (yay! [sarcasm]) we weren't sure if the hummus was hummus because it was nearly liquid.  Note to these guys: Hummus isn't canned chickpeas tossed in a blender--it requires more than that. \n\nBy the time we opened it up, we continued our experiment.  The \"lamb\" was frankly a ripoff.  It was bland, flavorless, and awful. The \"salad\" was another foray into I-really-don't-give-a-shit: it was iceberg lettuce and a smattering of chopped tomatoes.  The chicken wasn't as dry as Huong's, but was of slightly better quality.  It still had no major flavor nor nutritional value. The hummus was slightly grainy, runny, but it did stick to the fluffy, store-bought pita.The rice was slightly yellow and had a nutty, spice to it. In short: this sucked. This is one of the worst things I think we've eaten. Ever.\n\nScores:\nTime: Normal time here: about 8 minutes.  No complaints.\nValue-1: Crappy food for $8 each is not a value. \nGut check at 3pm: I'm not hungry, but I'm not happy either.  My dining partner complained of a grumbly belly. \nSustainability-1: Plastic, store-bought bread; processed meat.  This is a slash-and-burn policy toward earthly stewardship; sort of ironic given its name.  You know, Noah: the guy who tried to save the world by building a big boat.  And yeah, it's that Noah: they even have pictures of pairs of animals all over their sign and a big ark in the back. \nFear Factor-5: Well, crappy meat and low-quality, gloppy hummus wasn't a good start.  The dolmas tasted like they had turned; maybe they fermented in the jar.  We would not go back.  This was a dare.  And we took it for you, fair readers. \nStaying Power-1: There is no reason whatsoever for this place to stay in business.  It is too expensive for what you get, it is a slight against the food carts in the vicinity and it is so completely unoriginal, there is no reason to go here. These guys have no business staying in business.\nCreativity-1: I sometimes wonder if people emigrate here and get a business plan set up for them.  \"Here's the deal: these stupid Americans will buy anything. You make crappy food for three bucks, sell it for eight, and go home at three. This is a win-win.\" Except the loser is their customers.\nAs we walked by some of the carts that we will be visiting later, we saw pretty much the same menu at three other places.  This is a big stinker.",

So that said, corporate needs to implement better policies and procedures on getting things done for the apartment.\n\nThere's a lot of issues with my current apartment that it seems nothing is done to repair those issues. From bug infestation to a rat in our attic and a malfunctioned AC unit, boy do I wish maintenance can be on top of things - busy with other issues from other apartments to keep them away from the repairs we need, I know not - but it's been quite a while that I have heard anything as to the solutions to our problems.\n\nIn all honesty, I just don't appreciate the waiting for things to get done but I'm hopeful that corporate can see just how horribly things have gone with this apartment considering so many other negative reviews for years.",

I felt bad for the lady and several people commented on how rude that was. We quickly left it in the past and enjoyed the very beautiful grounds. We did the self guided tour and thought there were plenty of very informative information plaques placed throughout to get a very good idea of the times back then and the Pittock family.

I made it about half a mile before deciding that I wasn't going to find it and backtracked. At this point I see the Porter Exchange and a bunch of people walking out the door with to-go bags that covered in Japanese writing.

I cue up and then a lady comes out yelling at me that they are not accepting any more customers, that the people in front of me are the last people they are going to serve.\n\nNow I'm stuck in Porter Square with no Sapporo in my belly.

In addition, Victor makes you feel welcome and it was nice chatting with him. A great experience at possibly one of the best food carts in PDX.",

I have no clue what tax rate this guy is using??) which would have $15.00 shipping fees from all the way on Braker and Kraemer in Austin to Cedar Park and then they would need $65.00 more dollars to come back and install it.

I don't know how these idiots sleep at night condusting business like that!  \n\nTold him to take the 35.00 check to get him out of my house as I was home alone and he quite honestly scared me when he started talking all of his gibberish.

I have written another yelp review on ACC.  I will say that I find it mind bogging that ACC in their promotions state that they are in business for employers instead of students.  I guess that it splitting hairs but I think that this is pretty much the case.  It is interesting to me that I can no longer find ACC promotions. after I wrote this review.  The reason I stated this was because all of these agencies in power like TWFC and ACC brag about helping the employers instead of student\/jobseekers. I did find the promotion on the page by ACC Highland Business Center.  So it is there.  I think when the college started out they were more interested in helping students make it instead of viewing them just as future employees.

       "text":"Schmidt's is an institution in Columbus, and especially in German Village. The upside is that you can almost be assured of a good meal. The downside is of course the wait, which can be extremely long.\n\nOf course, there are worse things than having to kill time in German Village, especially as there are other bars nearby. Once you get seated, the servers are good about bringing food quickly. The inner decor is a little touristy, which is probably inevitable given the popularity of this restaurant. If it's sometimes kitschy, it can also be charming, especially with the live music they sometimes have.\n\nI'm a sucker for good schnitzel veal, and Schmidt's does not disappoint. That isn't to say that other choices are bad, and the sausages all looked good. If you can manage to fit any more food in your stomach, go for the cream puff. Whatever else can be said about it, you get your money's worth.",

       "text":"I just went yesterday around 3 pm and was hugely impressed.  Hunan Lion is in a crappy looking strip mall next door to a dollar tree so I from first glance outside it looks like any cheap chinese food restaurant. Don't let the outside appearance fool you though, it is not your typical chinese food place that serves $5 dollar lunch specials. \n\nInside it was very elegant.  Music was sort of jazz\/classical and not that stereotypical generic chinese music.  It was soft enough for conversation, dim overall in the restaurant but with just enough lighting the table from a hanging light.  The walls are mirrored with painted bamboo plants and a lot of elaborate vases and other decorations.  Hunan Lion seems like a very intimate place that would be great to impress a date.  It also had a HUGE bar area that looked awesome.  Service was also phenomenal.  My water was always full and our waitress was very polite and our food came out very quickly. There were only two tables of people to serve at the time so it wasn't busy but she really helped make the experience solid.\n\nThe food was great.  I went with a friend and we decided we had to try a typical chinese restaurant dish a long with something different.  We split a general tso's chicken to compare to the type of chinese we were used to.  It was delicious.  The sauce had a bit more garlic hint to it and the chicken chunks seemed a lot less \"mysterious\" than the typical general tso's that I am used to.  The breading had an unmatched crispiness that I really enjoyed.  The portion was large too but significantly more expensive at $11.95 than a cheap chinese restaurant's version for less than $5. I also tried the Thai red curry beef. It was very sweet with just the right kind of spice. Sweet at first, from the coconut milk and then spicy taste but never leaving a burning in my mouth. The vegetables were cooked just right to crispiness\/crunch and didn't seem slopped together in a sauce all at once. The curry was $12.95.  \n\nBefore Hunan Lion I honestly didn't know that \"fine\" or high quality chinese food existed in Ohio. This restaurant showed me that chinese food around these parts are not just cheap, quick, lower quality but tasty. Hunan Lion is a great place to try out some delicious cut above the rest chinese food if you are willing to spend a bit more money and impress some guests.",

Our waitress was the best part of our experience here ( Chris Romano) she was unbelievably friendly and very sweet and funny , if it wasn't for her I would be giving this place a 1 1\/2 stars . \n\n  We got burgers and loaded waffle fries and onion rings ( told made fresh and battered on site) .. Burgers were tasteless ( really) and waffle fries were rubbery ( microwaved) and TRUELY not lying my onion rings were cold REALLY NOT EVEN WARM , I think they forgot to microwave them , so I had waitress put her hand on them and she wAs appalled and told manager that it was our first time and that this would ruin our experience ( again she was adorable) .. Manager bought out feast order and apologized up and down ( she was very nice) ,, not 4 min. Later manager came back to offer us free dessert a gain very nice and sincere . \n  The dessert was fabulous lol ( Romano)      Had us get this peanut butter huge cake whip cream thing WOW . \n  I feel sadly I had to give two stars , but if rating was about the staff then perfect 10 would be in order ,, sorry C .

       "text":"In 2014, the City of Columbus actually named Schmidt's Bahama Mama the \"Official Food\" of Columbus. \n\nAnd yes, it's pretty good. So are their bratwursts and garlic knockwursts. Their cream puffs are really good too. (and gigantic) But I really can't shake the feeling that Schmidt's is overrated. For something to be so hyped and popular, it really should be mind blowing. The hand-made Czech sausages that I had at the Westside Market in Cleveland... now those were mind blowing. Schmidt's Bahama Mama on the other hand... they're good. But not mind blowing. \n\nThe Autobahn buffet is delicious and super filling, but does suffer from a relative lack of variety. (This type of sausage, that type of sausage, or maybe that other type of sausage?)\n\nWith that said, since they're so popular, the wait time at Schmidt's restaurant can be horrible. Over an hour on the weekends. The parking situation in German Village is also brutal. I hate waiting, and if I'm going to wait that long, I think I would rather wait down the street at Thurmans Cafe.  \n\nI also feel that the Schmidt's sausage truck is becoming too ubiquitous. Despite being a German restaurant based out of German Village, I've seen them at The Taste of Upper Arlington, The Columbus Italian Festival, and The Jazz & Ribs Fest, to name a few places. You know, events that have nothing to do with the German Village or sausages. It feels overcommercialized, and it takes away from the charm of a family owned restaurant.",

The Miang Kham is perfect for large groups to indulge in and it's super fun to grab the leaf, stuff it in your mouth, and feel the chili and lime explode with flavour in your mouth.\n \nThe curry was also one of the best I've had in Vancouver, and in my opinion tops the likes of U & I Thai and Spoon Kitchen handily. The bacon-wrapped lychee was an interesting appetizer but I would gladly take more of everything else. I can't say enough good things of the taste of the Fish and Chips since it's a cool idea and it's awesome how they keep the crunch of the batter with a much less oily version of traditional fish and chips.

Everything about it was extremely tasty but I also have to compliment the Cuban roll on which it was served.  It was so ultra fresh and good that it just made the sandwich.

Would you use this kind of butter in your seafood dishes?\n\nProblem: I only had half an hour to spend on dinner before the flight and asked the hostess if it was possible to get the food quickly enough. \n\nHostess: Said yes, and tried to take us to a table, but slowly wandered around confused and unsure which table to seat us in. I asked for a booth and she seemed relieved to have this conundrum solved. She told us the server would be with us shortly. \n\nServer: We waited for 5 minutes before the server showed up with the menus. I excitedly picked out a few items to try, and then flagged down the nearest server to take our menu.\n\nBus Boy: Turns out he was just a bus boy and told us the server should be with us shortly. We asked for water and he nodded his head.\n\nSilverware: I looked at my silverware, imagining the delicious food that our friends had told us about. And then I saw a brown 4 mm x 3 mm piece of food stuck to my knife. My friend flagged down the bus boy and asked for a replacement. The busser looked worried and hurriedly replaced the knife. Never got the water.\n\nDinner: We waited for the server to come. She came when we had 15 minutes left and we knew the cooks, no matter how good, could not possibly make the food fast enough for us to enjoy before our departure. We asked for a drink and 2 Kumamoto oysters and some water. The server smiled, nodded, and left.  \n\nWe waited and waited and stared into space with no water and only unhappiness. I mean, how long does it take to mix one drink and shuck two oysters? \n\nWe had had enough and decided to leave in search of quicker service and actual food and water. While leaving, the server smiled at us as if she had done a good job. When she realized that we hadn't even eaten, she ran after us and asked what was wrong. We explained that we'd told her about our time constraints and had been promised speedy service and that we unfortunately could not wait for their slow service any longer. She apologized and we left. \n\n\n\nLEGAL SEAFOOD why do you  have so many incompetent FOH workers? They all look the same. Same uniform and apparently the servers don't know how to pour water. They just kept giving us napkins instead. Do you have some sort of idiotic policy to give napkins instead of water? \n\nWe flagged down one FOH worker and asked to order. He said he was the bus boy, so we asked for water. It never came. We flagged down your server for water and she said the bus boy would get it. It never came. We flagged down the server to order. She took our orders and forgot about us. \n\nYour silverware is deplorable and your service is even worse. I'm sorry I missed out on \"the best seafood in Boston.\" Unfortunately, this experience was so taxing that I doubt I'll ever find the desire to step foot into any of your establishments.",

       "text":"Because it's near my work, and after seeing all the 5-star reviews here, a coworker friend and I decided to give Argo a try.\n\nIt's primarily a carry-out counter, but with four little tables for people who want to dine in.\n\nMy primary advice would be that despite the dine-in tables, this is primarily a takeout-only restaurant, and the customer experience is probably best in that vein. If you choose to sit down and eat, most of the experience is on a self-serve basis: get your own silverware, napkins, drink cup. The food is served in takeout containers, even for dine-in. And it's separate containers for every little element (lidded bowl for salad, lidded plastic dish for tzaziki, one carryout box for kalamari, a second separate one for rice and potato, and a wax paper envelop for pita bread). I can see how all this would be great for keeping the kalamari from getting soggy or the tzaziki or salad from getting too warm on a long drive home, but our order ticket was clear that we were eating in, and so it seemed excessive. I couldn't help feeling like I was eating an airplane meal, with all those tiny separate containers.\n\nIn slight contrast, my friend's souvlaki were served in a single larger carry-out plate on top of his rice and potato rather than in a separate box, and for the kalamari dinner that would have been at least one thing they could have done similarly, at least for dine-in, and both saved one extra item from the landfill and also reduced a somewhat awkward eating experience with all those little separate dishes.\n\nRegarding food: My friend had the lamb souvlaki dinner and I had the kalamari dinner, each accompanied by a large Greek salad, rice, potato, and tzaziki sauce. The serving size was generous. They offer the choice of lunch vs. dinner portions for most dishes, but not all (like the kalamari), and I probably could have saved both money and food waste by choosing an entree that has a lunch portion option.\n\nThe food itself was good enough. There are sit-down Greek places in the area I personally prefer a little better, but I doubt they have the kind of takeout efficiency that Argo has, so for takeout I'd be okay with Argo's food just because it's quick and easy. I'd like to try some of the other dishes, for example, the roast lamb, which seems to have got some good accolades.",

I can't wait to go back in spring, to see it in a whole new light! \nHighlights for people who love design and architecture are the Tiffany glaze Turkish smoking room, the fascinating curved design of the interior, and the fabulously well planned views from within the home.

Somewhere on it they claimed to be the best in Columbus, and my reply to that is... so-so. \n\nYou enter Hunan Lion through two huge wooden doors, and for some reason I was expecting hoakiness everywhere, but I was surprised. Go figure. I was also expecting a buffet. What? Can't a fat chick dream of buffet goodness? \n\nThe ambiance is somewhere between romantic, and edges a tad close to formal. I felt a bit out of place with my hoodie covered in buttons and safety pins, dawning pig tails, and blue jeans, but my fears were laid to rest after a group of greasy nerds came in. \nWe were seated after a ten minute wait in the center of one of the side rooms. I hate being a human spectacle, but I guess that will do since it was dinner rush. \n\nDespite the interesting conversation between a group of yuppies laughing about how their friend died while trying to climb through a window, it was nice... the ambiance and all. \nOur waitress is something the hubby and I still joke about from time to time. She was one of the most sassiest, surly, salty, Asian women I ever met. The lady says \"Yes?\" after every sentence, and if you don't reply Lord Cuthulu save your soul, because she got snippy. \n\nWe got our food in a timely manner. The appetizers were... well, actually they weren't good. I ordered an egg roll, which came out in two minutes. Microwave? I believe GOOD Asian food should never be pre prepped and should be cooked to order. \n\nMy Pad Thai was boring, but the boy's sesame chicken was to die for. If you go to Hunan Lion for anything, TRY THE SESAME CHICKEN!!! \n\nThe bill was received, and it was typical for pricey Chinese food. My husband asked the waitress out of curiosity if they sold Almond cookies, or made them. And of course the salty, surly, waitress misinterpreted what we were asking, and thus she said in an evil demonic tone, which snatching my husband's credit card to pay the bill, \"NO! No- ALMOND cookie.ONLY fortune COOKIE!\" and walked away. I think the hubby and I both had a \"wtf?\" look on our faces, but joked about it off and on for the rest of the night. \n\nThanks for the entertainment, Hunan Lion, but you're not really worth it unless you're trying to impress someone with ambiance and dark lighting. \n\nCranky Asian waitress, You do your thang, gurl.

We waited about an hour for a table, but we had a large group and it was a weekend night so I didn't mind. Service was \"meh.\" They have a great selection of beers. Waited a while to get beers at the bar, though. It was pretty crowded.\n\nThis was my first time at Tavern in the Square and I would go again just for beers and appetizers so I wouldn't have to spend so much- and perhaps go at a less busy time. Dinner was good, but not exactly worth it for the price. I might go to dinner here again if it was a special occasion or something. Not for a casual dinner.",

Lex gave us his professional experience from working with the catering business and Linda gave her professional opinion on the food, which was delicious! As soon as we entered we were taken off to a private area and brought samples of the dishes we had previously discussed.  Lex and Linda listened to our likes and dislikes and made further recommendations without being pushy.  They were fantastic!  We just know our wedding guests will love Carino's catering!",

I should be over this by now, but is it too much to expect someone to finally get it right, to get the noodles firm, the soup flavorful, and the gyoza delectable?  Apparently so.\n\nOne thing Sapporo Ramen has going for it is the atmosphere.  \"What?\" you may be saying, \"it's dirty and crowded and the water is in crappy plastic cups!\"  Indeed.   But this is precisely the atmosphere I mean.  We had a saying in Japan, that the dirtier and smaller the shop, the better the ramen.   It was by and large true.\n\nSadly, this is where (aside from Japanese ownership) the similarities end.  As other reviews have said, the soup is bland (no amount of additives can save it) bland bland and even oilier than that aforementioned \"real thing.\"  The meat and veggies are pretty tasteless too.  The portions are about the right size, so there's a half-star, but I actually couldn't even finish a regular-sized bowl because it was so tasteless.\n\nI would've given this place two stars, but for the shining exception of the gyoza (\"dumplings\").  I didn't have the veggie kind but I can say that the regular kind were very good.  A little small, but good.  Unfortunately, their yummitude just serve as a reminder of what the ramen is not.\n\nBottom Line: Very bland soup, though the noodles are okay.  Portions are fine.  Gyoza is good.  Three stars.",

While they have a large menu, they also have an assorted mix of pizzas ready by the slice - including a wheat crust.\n\nUnlike other pizza joints, we especially enjoy Bill's pizza and calzones for a delicious non-greasy crust and the wide variety of ingredients to choose from. We order from them about once a week for pick-up and we have never had any problems with our orders. The atmosphere is nice for eating in as well with lots of cool artwork on the walls and sometimes live music.

       "text":"Let me set the stage:\n\nIt's Halloween evening, Friday night, and I've got a packed schedule. I miss my haircut by 15 minutes at a salon in South Boston and have to be at my next event in 2 hours -- ready to go with hair done, and I have no time to get back home. I call a few places in the area but everyone is booked. Finally, I remember Toscana and a sign they had out front advertising $30 blowouts. Luckily, they've got an opening and I book it over to Newbury St. within 45 minutes during rush hour.\n\nThe staff was pleasant and friendly and my blowout was pretty good. My hair was super shiny, though it didn't hold\/last for as long as most blowouts do, even though I asked for specific products to aid with that. Still, for $30 and 45 minutes notice, I was so pleased with how it turned out. I have to reiterate: everyone from my stylist to the receptionist to the man who offered me tea or water was so friendly and polite, even at the end of a long Friday. \n\n5 stars for customer service, 4 stars for blowout quality.",

Most unhappy customers are the first ones to post....please do not let their experiences cause you reluctancty to schedule.  \nBook your appointment. Whether it's hair or nails,  book it ahead of time and be specific of what you want.\nI've spent a lot of time at this salon. On my hair.\nI went from almost black natural hair to platinum blonde,  that took almost 19 hours.  \nI've had my hair cut here previously, my hair is super thick and it takes HOURS...ive seen first hand their customer service when It comes to nails, they do great. \nFor hair, Lakyn is amazing. She takes pride in what she does and does not let you leave until it's perfect. She puts so much thought and effort into each step. What I appreciate most is she does not let you sit under a dryer when doing highlights or color, it can fry your hair. I receive so much education about my hair from Lakyn. My before and after photos are amazing and i absolutely love my hair. \nI will never go to another salon in Columbus. Lakyn is a gift from God, she is truly talented.\nOh and by the way, they will be adding in a bar to the salon so definitely will be a good place to book bridal parties or birthday parties!!!\nFor this salon,  call ahead to make appointments whether it be for hair or nails. Allow yourself extra time so please don't be on a rush to get done, everyone at this salon takes their time and it's greatly appreciated!",

We had about 7 bids from different painters and Kieran was the ONLY one who gave us honest answers about what the walls would look like when he got finished. He took the time to go over all the details of the job and answered all of our questions. The price he quoted was more than fair and the entire process he kept us informed. He and his crew showed up when they said they would and even showed up a little early to set things up. On the last day of the job we took a look at his work and were blown away. Not only did he meet but completely exceeded our expectations. Kieran finished the job late on a Friday. He politely asked if he could come back on Saturday to clean the rest of the dust up. To say the least Kieran left the house cleaner than when he came. We would 100% recommend him to anyone looking for an honest painter who simply wants the job done right.",

       "text":"The OG of Boston area ramen. This 18 seat noodle stall in the food court of Porter Exchange (now owned by Lesley University) has been around over 20 years. \nNoodles are medium-thin wavy. Very basic in taste and texture, soft most of the time. \nThere is a wide variety of choices here. Their mother broth is a chicken\/vegetable boiled high and long. Nice golden color, just a hint of bubbly sheen, more rich and flavorful than one would expect.  On some days a hint of bitterness comes through. Tantan Men arrives looking like a fiery sunset. It is rich with toasted sesame, nuts, and chili powder. Miso is a miss; creamy but lacking in flavor. Spicy Miso has decent heat. Hot & Sour tries hard but needs more vinegar to go with the chili oil. Curry Ramen is blah. \nThinly sliced lean pork loin is decent. Fairly tender, you can taste the soy marinade. Skimpy amount of ground pork for bowls that have it. \nSome stomachs might not be satisfied with the portions here. You can order extra or double noodles if that is the case.\n\nPassable ramen for the region. Sapporo has name recognition since they have been in business so long. Expect a bit of a wait most of the time. Also note they close for their traditional break between 3-5pm. Cash only.",

Can there be any disappointment greater than looking forward to eating, only to being met by a closed door?? Fortunately, tenacity (when it comes to food and all things food related) is my forte, and my darling dining companion and I endured grumbling tummies for the sake of pad thai. Let it be known, Yelpers, that Bob Likes Thai Food is closed between 3:00-5:00pm during the week. Weekends are continuous, 11:30am to 9:00pm.\n\nAs soon as 5:00pm rolled around, we headed back over to BLTF. Ambiance, as others have noted, is minimalist but functional. We settled in eagerly and were served water from the get-go. One gripe...the cups were so small that one drink of water effectively emptied half the glass. This meant that servers were constantly hovering and refilling water, which was a bit awkward, especially if you're like me and feel the need to say \"thanks\"...every single time.  \n\nBeing pad thai fanatics, neither of us could be persuaded by anything else on the menu. But the swimming rama beckoned...what to do? We ordered it all! The pad thai was delicious, although not quite spicy enough for my tastes. The swimming rama was also tasty, but the pad thai was the clear winner. Hopefully, we will be able to break free from the grips of pad thai to order more broadly off the menu for future visits. I also heard the server saying that most menu items can be made vegetarian, by subbing tofu in place of meat. Portions were indeed smaller than one normally finds at thai places (never too much pad thai!), but I suppose the prices are marginally cheaper. Our meal wasn't anything outstanding, but it was very good...we walked away totally stuffed and happy, anyway.",

Nearly 45 MIN LATER!! (ridiculous) I saw people that got there after us get their food before us.. food came out. So I know I asked for the fish w\/o the cream sauce but damnnn did this dish look BLEAK! It wasn't seasoned or anything .. no flavor no nothing..It wasn't even hot. Talk about room- temperature fish YUUCK!\n\nI was to shy at the time to pipe up and talk to the manager.. but I did however let the waitress know I wasn't happy and she could tell obv by my untouched plate of food. She acted totally rude about it and just brushed me off..NEVER AGAIN!",

The advantage of this location is that there isn't a Panera Bread or Jason's Deli close to downtown, so I expect they would get a lot of rush during the weekday lunch hour.\n\nI like to go for my reliable staple of the roast beef sandwich, which they serve rare, and the pimento Mac n cheese which has the right oomph of bacon flavor.",

I'm happy for them as their children are now grown up and able to help out on the floor. \n\nPs. They add the ingredients fresh to order for the hot and sour soup!

I will definitely return again even without a Groupon. Now what would I order with $30 to spend?? \n\nI had the sambusa stuffed with beef. That's pastry dough stuffed with beef, oh my, the pastry was so soft and very sweet! Greasy, but worth it. \n\nI had a butternut squash soup. Thick and creamy and delicious! \n\nI ordered the Sabayat combo platter (1 meat, 2 veggies)- goat meat, Chickpeas, green lentils. BTW, if you are confused by the difference between Anjeero and the Sabayat combos, the difference is the bread. Anjeero is spongy bread, Sabayat is more like a flatbread. I had anjeero at another ethopian restaurant and decided it wasn't really my thing, so I went with the sabayat. I really loved the sabayat here, I was piling the meat\/veggies on it and just stuffing it in my mouth. I went with goat because reviewers said the goat was great. The goat meat was my first experience, and the meat was tender and flavorful. I WILL ORDER GOAT AGAIN! I enjoyed the chickpeas and lentils as well. \n\nAnd to finish- a Mango lassie smoothie. Tasted fresh and fruity, delicious! \n\n All of it came to around $26. Dang it, didn't spend $30, but I couldn't possibly eat another bite!",

I wanted to see what the rave and hype was all about and it definitely lives up to it! We tried the bratwurst and bahama mama with fries. They serve them in hotdog buns and provide horseradish sauce and mustard. We ordered on the side sauerkraut and fries (served as waffle fries). The bahama mama was really good, but definitely prefer the original bratwurst. Each bite was so savory and juicy. I really regretted not trying their wide assortment of desserts, which all looked tasty. The restaurant is located in German Village, which is a cute and pretty neighborhood to check out in Columbus, Ohio so it gets packed and super busy on the weekends. We walked in around 3 and still had to wait 45 min to an hour, but there is a take out option if you don't want to wait.",

I gave the place a generous three stars for the bland, fast-food-style burrito that was a chunk of grease.  Sure ... generous amounts of low-quality beef and processed cheese. The cook must be a huge fan of Taco Bell. I returned in desperation for a fast breakfast taco. (The place is close to where I live.) And not only did I wait forever, I was served the worst taco I've ever had, a tablespoon of dry chorizo mixed with my egg ... yes a TABLESPOON.  It tasted like it had been cooked a few days before and refrigerated.  And I think they must really be cutting corners ... yes a TABLESPOON.  C'mon dudes!  AND ... a true pet peeve of mine, the damn TV was on, a clear sign that the employees' needs are being met first and not the customers'.  I'm sure this place at one time had good intentions as a mom 'n pop local Mexican restaurant, but it's clear everyone involved--customers included--have become complacent with crappy food.  If you eat at Taco Bell everyday, I'm sure it starts to taste good after awhile.  Olmecas has the right formula for success: cheap ingredients, cheap prices, and lots of grease.",

It was a decent drive and we didn't get in until around 9PM.

They ended up refunding our money (refund currently pending...) and paid for our stay at the Fairfield Inn..I would probably have given them 3 stars but the Fairfield wasn't very comparable to a Doubletree and all they had were rooms with double beds.

       "text":"I think this practice epitomizes what's wrong with healthcare today.  Doctors are incentivized too much for useless visits and tests.  I think we've had 5 ultrasounds so far and we're not even into our third trimester.  For other friends, they've had one..maybe two.  But that was just part of it..overall, we felt like just a number to the doctors of this practice.  Throughput is the key to making money and they are definitely good at that. \n\nThey are so good in fact that because they are so busy, they lost a patient in the shuffle.  A friend's friend who also left the practice said that she was left in her room for over an hour and was only \"found\" when they tried to stick someone into her room for another appointment.\n\nThere are many other practices in the Boston area and I would say that you try to look there before you think about this one.  But to be completely fair, we did find out about this practice through a friend who enjoyed her services rendered.  So 2 negative experiences...one positive.  Not great odds when someone is in charge of the birth of your child...but that's up to you.",

I tried to get both David K and Andre S out with me, but both had pretty exciting Thursday nights and wanted to rest.  \n\nYou can't go wrong with Blakes.  It's one of the only original gay bars left in Atlanta that doesn't suck and no cover!!!  It's always packed with the best looking crowd in Atlanta plus you will pretty much run into your friends and a good amount of people you know from the gym, work, friends of friends, yelpers, etc... As Robert said yesterday to perfectly explain the scene...\"Everyone is a bit cookie cutter and way too pretty!\"  Of course I replied...\"What's wrong with that!?\"  HA!  Oh and its pretty diverse with male\/female, all nationalities and ages.\n\nThe bartenders are pretty attentive.  We were able to get drinks pretty quickly although the drinks aren't that great.  I love the redo of the entire 2nd floor.  It's a nice escape if you are like me and not totally into the drag shows.  The only thing I wish they had was more seating and a larger patio.  It was super hot on the 2nd floor and we had to keep moving down to the first floor to cool off.  I swear they keep it hot to have people wear less clothing!\n\nDefinitely check it out!  I wouldn't say that anyone there was rude or snobby (c'mon now, its the gays), but people do like to stay in their clicks.  So invite a group of friends, bring a hag or two with you and have a great time!  Say hello if you see me!",

These items would have been forgiven by Legals high quality of food but not this time.   My fishermans platter was deep fried with varying degrees of brown, some cooked to a beautiful golden brown and some over cooked.  The topper was the layer of grease on the bottom of the plate which had saturated all of the seafood and rings which were on the bottom.

I knew that Schmidt's was famous for sausage, so I focused my attention on the buffet.  4 types of sausage and a sausage stew.  My favorites were the Bahama Mama and the Garlic Knockwurst.  I found the Bratwurst to be a bit dry and not to my taste.  I also had the buffet for the German sides.  The Kraut and Red Cabbage were very good, but the hot German potato salad alone was worth the trip.  The traditional ham and white bean soup was also a real treat.\n\nBeing a beer fan, I tried the 6 (2 oz) sampler with 3 local beers and 3 German.  Sorry Columbus, I was not impressed with your local micro brewed beer.  However, the 3 German selections went perfectly with the food.  They were a hearty flavor that brought out all of the greatness of beer and food pairing.  2 Warsteiner (Premium & Dunkel) 1 Paulaner Octoberfest Marzen.  \n\nThe giant cream puffs...beautiful to look at.  I'm holding my vote for another time.  It could have been that I indulged and enjoyed the dinner food and beverages too much and didn't leave enough room or discernment for dessert.

       "text":"Well, I read these great reviews on Yelp for this place and said, we've got to try this. \n\nMy husband and I experienced nothing interesting or even especially good, though very expensive for lunch. We both had lunch items from the lunch vermicelli platters, I had grilled shrimp and he had steak. We agreed the actual shrimp and beef pieces were excellent, but everything with them was bland to the point of tasteless. \n\nThe side sauces of a syrupy sweet sauce and red peppery sauce, I suppose, were supposed to help, but though nothing was what I would call \"bad,\" nothing was good or flavorful. And the menu said an egg roll was included, which turned out to be so small that at first I missed it - cut into two barely bite sized pieces buried inside the salad. Basically the main dish was a big bow of greens and plain, un-sauced noodles, for $12.50 each!  I could've like it with,say, an oyster sauce.  SOMETHING.\n\nAlso, we originally ordered glasses of Pinot Grigio, which were obviously oxidized upon smelling and tasting. The server willingly replaced these with Chardonnays, but a server who can't tell that an orange glass of white wine is obviously not good, not to mention the smell, well, that is unprofessional at an inexcusable level. \n\nWe live in Titusville and can find far better options for $12+ a piece for lunch. Nah, I don't see what these good reviews are based on. Saw nothing worth returning for.",

       "text":"Took my three kids for an early lunch on Sunday, figuring we would probably have the patio to ourselves which I need with a 7, 6 and 4 year old all with grumbling stomachs.  We sat down and were told it would take another 10 minutes for the lunch menu to become available.  Ok, my kids weren't slighly bouncing off the walls, but we secured some crayons and were good to go.  \n\nThe waiter came by right away, and grabbed us some drinks.  Kids were distracted.  Bumped into a few folks I knew at a table across from us.  They were navigating the breakfast buffet, while I was still waiting for the clock to hit noon.  Noon!  Bingo, waiter graces our table again.  Alas, I can order.  Mac and cheese for kids, and apple goat cheese salad for myself.  Order came quick enough, but was slighly turned off that each kid got served an entire box of kraft mac and cheese each.  I mean, really, a box?  Anyway, my salad arrived in a very pretty tipsy bowl, as others have commented about.  Looked nice but not so practical.  \n\nSalad ok, I actually  make a better one, and for price, I would actually rather have one at Burtons!  Kids seems like they were having a terrible time getting through the piles of endless mac and cheese.  After 10 minutes I called over the waiter, and said please take the kids food away, but not before my son started rolling back his eyes and telling me his belly hurt.  \n\nIn the meantime, my friends across the way were commenting how bad the breakfast buffet was.  I mean when they held up something we had to guess at what it was (eggs or cheese no idea), I was so thankful I didn't order it.  It was very obvious they were trying to eat 20 bucks worth each, but were having an awful time.\n\nSo the kid meals came with hoodsies, so I figured, what the heck, I had the whole day to kill, and I am sure we were not disturbing everybody on the patio at this point.  The hoodsies arrived all melted and my girls decided to drink them instead.  My youngest asks the waiter, did they put the ice cream in the oven?  God love her.\n\nDid Tavern disappoint?  Not exactly, I knew what I was in for.  Would I run back?  Probably not.  Looks like it could be a half decent drink and app place on an off night.",

Perhaps because the place is crowded on a weekend and the cooks are rushing but netherless, the food came out meh.\n\nLet's start off on what I did enjoy\nCoffee\nOrange Juice.\nLarge Portions - (But this probably attributes to my bad issues below)\n\nNow for the bad.\n\nWhy can't any place make eggs well done or dry?  The eggs were still pretty wet and fluffy and if I hadn't specified how I wanted the eggs, would they have just gave me a raw yolk on a plate?\n\nBacon is fatty, uncooked and skimpy.  It's like they bought the reduced fat bacon that's  as thin as paper but of poor quality such that most is made up of fat. Then you don't cook it long enough because the grill is too high so you half part of it burned and the other part undone.\n\nToast is not bad but not great.  Store brand cheap bread.  Doesn't matter if you ask for wheat as it's just as bad as white bread because of the quality.\n\nWaffles.  I thought belgian but they were just regular waffles.  Seems the waffle maker wasn't clean so you get the old burned up oil residue all over your waffles.  Thus, they have an awful aftertaste to them.\n\nHomefries.  Just like the bacon, cooked too fast.  Thus half is burned, half is uncooked\/raw.  No seasoning on the fries either.\n\nI think this place is into quantity over quality food.  People give it high ratings cause you get a bunch of trash.  I rather less food, better tasting.\n\nI'm sorry to offend but I work in the financial district and the breakfast place I go there (whose rent is waaaaay higher than this diner) is actually cheaper and uses fresher and better quality ingredients.

The restaurant does tend to be filled up quick as it's a popular place.\n\nThe buffet is a good idea to get if you want to a sampling of the different sausages. Or just go ala-carte if you want some of their specials.\n\nI recommend any of the spiced sausages and the meat stuffed cabbages. The pickled red cabbage is a good side and so are the potatoe pancakes with apple sauce. Plus, portions are large and filling, and I'm basing this on a regular person's stomach instead of mine for a fair evaluation LOL.\n\nHoliday drinks are great and they sure don't skimp on the alcohol in your whisky cider or cinnamon rum.",

       "text":"Came here for my birthday lunch. Chose this place so I could partake in the chips and vidalia onion dip because I tend to crave it every time I see the restaurant. We have been to this location maybe one other time before, and have always had a good experience. Great wait staff, really friendly hostesses. They are nice to kids. This is especially important to note because when we came in, I asked to be seated in a booth because booths keep our active 4 year old ... less active during dinner. But because they have a really nice (giant) ceiling fan, my son wanted no part in sitting in the back of the restaurant in a booth and made it clear to the entire restaurant he wouldn't sit there. He lead the way and found a new seat. In front of the fan and in the view of the patio seating (which also has fans)... and she was extremely friendly following around the dictator to the seat he wanted. (a seat we should have originally asked for anyway....). He was happy the whole time we were there thanks to her being so patient... \n\nAnyway, you really can't go wrong with a meal here. They have something for everyone. It's a lot less chaotic at this location than the one in Allston, so that's a plus. The kitchen and the staff are all very efficient. If you come to the area to shop, definitely eat here! You won't be disappointed.",

Ice cream, shakes, frozen yogurt, and waffle cone flavors fill the chalk boards. We tasted a few flavors and went with the pistachio in a white chocolate dipped wafffle cone. Sooo creamy and real big pieces of pistachio! The service was fast and friendly.\n\nMy one complaint is the price. It costs around $5 for this scoop and the waffle cone was even on sale for 50 cents. This meant normally it would've been around $6...too much for one scoop of ice cream. \n\nOverall, good experience. I'd like to try the fro-yo next!",

My friend and I both weren't very hungry so we decided we'd split a savory crepe and a sweet crepe so we could try both types without over-stuffing ourselves. When I asked the lady if she could cut the crepe in half, she said \"no we can't do that, it'll make a mess.\" Well guess what lady, if you make a mess, then we'll make an even bigger mess when cutting it since you have a butcher knife and we'll be using plastic knives! Anywho, in the end she ended up grudgingly cutting it in half with her sharp butcher knife and it didn't make a mess, so I appreciate her gesture. We got the California crepe which was a bit Americanized but still tasty. Then for dessert we had the strawberry banana caramel crepe which was also quite yummy. It'll fill you up quick since the dough is quite thick.",

However, unlike many other Americanized Chinese food places, Yan's offers lots of fresh veggies and great flavor in their dishes. \n\nThe prices are a little high for their appetizers, but I find their combination plates to be a great deal: choice of appetizers, fried rice\/rice\/lo mein, and a main dish for ~$8. I love their chicken teriyaki and crab rangoons. I've realized that some of their dishes are variations of each other: sesame chicken tasted like the General Gau's chicken, except not as spicy and with a generous sprinkling of sesame on top; likewise, the cashew chicken is almost an exact replica of the Kung Pao chicken, except with cashews instead of peanuts. \n\nI've been ordering delivery from the oh-so-convenient website and always get the Kung Pao chicken: it's one of the yummiest renditions of the dish I've had, chock-full of flash fried chicken and fresh veggies (celery, carrots, green peppers, and ZUCCHINI!). Not to mention, their pork fried rice has bean sprouts in it and actual substantial pieces of spareribs. \n\nSo while not the cheapest Chinese takeout\/delivery you can get, it's certainly the best in the area and the quality of ingredients and all the veggies make it a great deal.",

I could have had a huge steak with a salad bar thrown in on the side for that price! \n\nI'll grant you, the food is good, but not $40 good. The salad tasted great. The breads and soups were good. Other than the ridiculous price, the mac-n-cheese would be my only other complaint. It was bland, soupy and tasteless. (Who messes up mac-n-cheese?) \n\nSweet Tomatoes reminds me of a Golden Corral buffet that is missing 90% of the usual  tasty and fattening foods. I'm not sure what the real draw is for Sweet Tomatoes, since the restaurant was packed with people when I was there, but they have some how been able to con people into buying expensive salads. I guess if Starbucks can sell $5 cups of coffee, then Sweet Tomatoes can sell $40 salads.   \n\nThere is no way you could ever get me back inside another Sweet Tomatoes until they lower their price by about 75%",

       "text":"If you want a German sausage...this is your place!\n\nWho doesn't like German food? This place is one of a kind and a must whether you are new in town, have family visiting or just simply want some good old German food.\n\nI hear good things about the autobahn...and yes I have actually been to the real autobahn in Germany but still have yet to try the Schmidt's version =). I have tried many of their sausage selections and can't say anything bad about them. But, my most favorite is of course a good fried schnitzel, which is absolutely an option here.  In fact, Schmidt's food is better than the first Hofbrauhaus in Munich I visited a few months back...and I am not exaggerating when I say this because I come from a European family and grew up eating homemade schnitzels and sausages. Not to mention this place has such a fun atmosphere with live music and is nestled in the heart of beautiful German Village.\n\nYou will love it, give this place a try!",

Working in customer service, customer service is a major aspect to me in where I shop, and spent my money. Image Nails is by far the best nail salon I have ever been to and their customer service is exceptional. I live by UCF which is a good 30 minute drive, and I have absolutely no problem traveling to them. The more I became acquainted with the staff the more I loved each and every time I stopped by. I feel like most nail salons want you in and out, and the customer service is never up to par. I've never had that problem at Image Nails. \n\nThank you to the staff for always providing superb customer service. Nothing you do goes unnoticed.",

       "text":"I know you're touristy and kitschy. People are down on you all the time as NOT being authentic. This is not German food. Well, I beg their pardon...but you are very German food. \n\nHaving been to Germany, I am no authority, but I do know that there are many types of German restaurants that offer different types of German food. And you are every bit as authentic as that bar in Dusseldorf along the Rhine selling pig's knuckles with kraut......Yes Folks, it's not German FINE dining but it is German pub grub. \n\nIt's a great place for a work lunch or when you need to kick back for a brew or two. Schmidt's specialty brews are tasty and Warsteineron tap is like being in the old country. \n\nI personally can not imagine eating here without ordering the buffet. It is your best value and it is the best way to eat what they do best. The SAUSAGE. Founded as a meat packer, this place knows its bratwurst, knockwurst and its bahama mama spicy sausages. They are quality meat and delicious. Plus you can buy some bulk and take them home if you want to grill some or if you want to make your own sausage dishes. \n\nThe next best thing on the buffet is the Potato Soup. Always available, they will serve you a cup with the buffet even if it's not the \"featured\" soup on the buffet. Velvety and smooth - just like Oma (Grandma) made...make it even better with some real bacon and cheddar cheese from the salad bar. \n\nOther things on the buffet are good as well - mac and cheese is better than any bbq joint's mac and cheese I've eaten. The red cabbage may be canned but is enhanced with spices and Jonathan apples. The kraut is canned, yet spiked with caraway in every bite and is appropriately sour to the tongue, not watered down. The German Potato Salad is home made and the German Sweet Kraut on the salad bar is a classic sweet Sauerkraut Salad. Corned beef and cabbage on the buffet is always freshly made. Not authentic? Well, I'd say there are plenty of restaurants in Germany that use canned, commercially processed kraut and cabbage......Have you not seen the jars and cans in the German section of your grocer or World Market? \n\nThe desserts are ok. The cream puffs are raved about - I personally avoid them because of the use of some unknown whipped topping\" kind of filling. I'd prefer pastry cream. The German Chocolate cake appears authentic - meaning made with German's brand Sweet Chocolate since  the authentic dessert of the country would probably be a Black Forrest Cake with real whipped cream. \n\nSo anyway, I am a fan. People who belittle its authenticity have likely never visited the country to appreciate the bar\/pub side of Germany, which is a shame because the German's know their bier and their sausage.",

Maybe I just caught someone on a bad day, but the guy that gave me my photos hardly said anything to me. When I looked at the prints (duplicates of 4 photos), one of the images looked like my fiance had been sprayed with a water gun. It seemed to have something to do with the complex pattern of his shirt and hat, but when I pointed it out, the guy didn't say ANYTHING. He didn't offer an excuse, much less offer to reprint them. On top of it all, their parking lot is tiny and it's on a very busy street, so the experience was already stressful before I walked in the door.\n\nFortunately, I'd happened to get a random \"deal\" so the prints were already free. I didn't bother complaining because I figured it wouldn't be worth the time for either parties. Instead, I ordered the same photo from Walgreens the next day and received surprisingly excellent prints. I don't believe I'll be visiting this store again. I'd advise either brightening or softening photos before having them printed here, perhaps that would prevent such oddities that I encountered.",

       "text":"The best ramen I have ever had.  In general, some of the best soup I've ever eaten.  And in fact, some of the best food that I have ever put in my mouth.  When I lived in Cambridge there is no place that I ate at half so often as Sapporo Ramen. \n\nThey've updated their menu and decor.  The decor is must improved by the changes.  The House is, in my opinion, improved, but my girlfriend likes the old way better because the newer broth is thicker.  We both agree that the new house is delicious and appreciate the addition of an egg.   \n\nUnfortunately, the gyoza are worse.  The leek flavor is too strong and makes them just like all the other dumplings around.  Worst of all, the soy sauce soup that came with the dumpling set is no longer on the menu.\n\nHowever, one redeeming factor is the addition of the ground spicy pork ramen to the lineup.  That soup is just the bomb.  \n\nSo, definitely don't miss.",

YES.\n\nFirst time coming here, I've passed by this place countless times, but I was waiting for a prescription to fill out at CVS in front so I figured why not try this place out. The first time I popped in, I was told to come by 20 min later...I figured the main stylist was out on a dinner break or something.\n\n I'm always worried going to a new person for eyebrow waxing, as I had a bad experience at a salon in Allston where they nearly took out my entire eyebrows -.- so I've stuck with my mainstay at Ruby's in Back Bay. But Ecco is incredibly clean, very professional looking and streamlined, which put me at ease. I came back, was offered water by a nice gentleman , and led to the back soon afterwards.The massage\/waxing room in the back is very relaxing and comfortable, a major plus. The waxing job was quick, and she gave me a 2 minute head massage afterwards which was a nice and unexpected bonus :) \n\nI am interested to coming back, especially for a massage! I'm also interested in perhaps having my hair styled by her, since it seems affordable yet good.",

I asked the lady there if anything vegan and she gave me that \"vegan what?\" look before saying nothing there was vegan. (There were in fact \"steamed veggies\" but even though I wanted hot food, I wanted something with a little more flavor.)\n\nThen I noticed there were two other sections past that, with quite a lot of vegetarian salads and sandwiches. Still not much vegan, but they had some hummus and a pasta salad marked with a little \"v\", which the guy said meant they were vegan. I got some of each, and was shocked at the HUGE portion for only about $10. Seriously it's over a cup of hummus, a pile of pita chips, and maybe 2 cups of pasta salad. It's pretty tasty too.\n\n\n\nPoints deducted for serving in styrofoam, however. You'd think a place called \"Nature's Table\" would be a little more environmentally conscious. Alas no, we are at the airport after all....",

And Hannah was a total sweetheart! \n\nThe four stars instead of five are because I arrived for a 9:00 appointment about 10 minutes early. I recognize that they open at 9:00. However, there was no one there to greet me or tell me where to go or to even kick me out until they opened.

I was intrigued by the orange tomato soup, but we needed some eggs and protein in the morning. Many of the baked goods, including the blueberry coffeecake was fresh from that morning, and it was about 8:30 in the morning, sooooooooooooo delicious and a much-needed picker-upper in the morning. \n\nThe people behind the counter seem all very hipster-y and Urban Outfitters-y.

Their black beans are meltingly tender and perfectly seasoned, the yellow rice is delicious - this combo is the first thing I start with and end up taking 3\/4 of my main course home for another meal. The cuban sandwiches are freaking terrific, as well as the flank steak, pork and shrimp dishes. There are few places that make a really good mojito - Papi's does with generous amounts of the real thick mint, not the wimpy common variety.\n\nThe Cuban milkshake - ahhhh ~Love~ just get one, thank me later.\n\nPrices are very reasonable, portions are generous. All around a good solid YUM meal with leftovers.\n\nThe only negative would be the incredible noise in the restaurant, there is no sound dampening at all. The larger sound room is an echo chamber, so if you like it a little calmer go during the day.\n\nParking can get interesting during busy times. It's right across the street from Mary Mac's, you cannot park in their parking lot. So there is a small lot behind Papi's shared with another business as well as pay for street parking. The parking cops here are ferocious, make sure you do not park in the handicap parking spots unless you like $200 tickets.",

       "text":"When it comes to eating, napkins are probably not something that most people think much into; but as a child, they were my saving grace.  For YEARS I use to line my pockets with napkins and nonchalantly slip all the food I didn't like into them, only to promptly flush it down the toilet or stuff it to the bottom of the trash can after meals (Shh...don't tell the starving kids in Africa!).   I had this process down to an art, and for all my parents knew...I was eating my dinner like a good little girl.  \n\nThis lovely memory crosses my mind whenever I have to go to Cleary's.  As I glance over the menu (praying that it changed), I wish nothing more than being able to revert back to my younger days  and bring back the ol' napkin trick.  \n\nI am trying my hardest to find something positive to say about this place, but it is proving to be difficult.   If my memory serves me right, the chicken strip salad was tolerable (meaning no napkins were involved)...but seeing as I have been a vegetarian for 9 years, I am kind of S.O.L. on that option.  I suppose their plain salad is pretty safe, but a plate of lettuce is really nothing to write home about.  Everything else semi vegetarian friendly is deep fried and\/or pocket shove-able. \n\nOverall, something about this place really creeps me out.  Maybe it is the bazaar decorations that range in themes from Sesame Street to Elvis Presley, or maybe it's the freaky Cher albums I somehow always get stuck sitting by.  Whatever it may be, I didn't like it as a child and I really don't like it now.  \n\nIf you like gross grease food...ignore my bias ways and see my sister's review below.  If not, have a napkin handy if you ever find yourself stuck here!",

We went Sunday night (Father's day) and half expected to wait but luckily we were seated right away. Eve. Though it was slightly busy the server got to us relatively quickly. \n\nStarted with the Gyoza dumplings which were lightly battered and fried to perfection. For the main course we split 4 specialty rolls: Volcano, Heaven & Earth, Shaggy King, and the cream cheese crawfish hand roll. All of them were delicious but the Heaven & Earth was by far the best, with the volcano coming in a close 2nd place. \n\nNormally I can put down a good deal by myself but my date and I ended up leaving a few pieces on the table. Will definitely be back to try again. \n\nSide note: they have tv screens setup around the restaurant which allow you to watch the sushi being made even though you aren't at the bar.

I'm very picky about my manicure, and one of my pet peeves is when the manicurist doesn't polish the sides of my nails.  I have oddly shaped nails, so most people miss the sides.  Beth polished them all the way to the sides without me even pointing it out to her.  She was so precise and made sure every single nail looked perfect.  She's also a lot of fun to talk to.  She made me feel like we were old friends just chatting away.  Will definitely go back and ask for Beth.\n\nAlso, I must mention the decor and other little details that made The Posh Spot stand out in my opinion.  When I called to make my appointment, I gave my email address and by the time I got back home, I had received an email thanking me for coming and providing a breakdown of my services and telling me which person did my manicure.  Very personalized!  The space is just beautiful.  It's decorated in warm colors that are relaxing to the senses.  The lighting is nice and calming and not bright and busy-feeling.  The pedicure seats are elevated and very roomy with pretty throw pillows for your back.  Even the bowls where they rinse your feet are pretty and chic.\n\nAnyone can do a good mani\/pedi, but my entire experience from the time a called to make an appointment bring the following words to mind . . . upscale, professional, detail-oriented, special, and well \"posh\".  I agree with the other poster who said it was upscale without being snooty.  And the price is definitely good for the quality of service you get.\n\nThis is going to be my new favorite spa!",

       "text":"I've been seeing some iffy reviews about Sapporo on here, so I thought I'd chime in. When you're choosing a ramen place to eat in Boston, you pretty much have to pick and choose based on what your priorities are-- they all have their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSapporo ramen's best feature is its light-tasting, yet incredibly collagen-rich and creamy broth. (There's definitely no butter in it.) The noodles are also perfectly cooked and have an excellent springiness that stands up to sitting in the broth for some time. Sapporo's weaknesses: its eggs, which are not traditional marinated soft-boiled ramen eggs, but simply hard-boiled eggs; and its pork, which is not braised to tenderness (though it's not bad). The egg thing definitely disappoints me; it kind of breaks the spell that a good bowl of ramen creates. But the broth, noodles, and toppings are heartbreakingly good, and Sapporo is among the ramen places around town I find myself craving the most often. I get either the house (plain tonkotsu) ramen or the spicy miso, which does away with whole sliced pork and includes ground pork in a sweet-and-spicy oil. If Sapporo changed its eggs, I'd throw on another star. But 'til then, this is still a safe bet for a good bowl of ramen.",

       "text":"I've dined at Eurasia three times. First couple of time even though the food being outstanding I was a bit confused. Perhaps the kitchen taking the name\/initial vision too literally. You order an entree and get your choice of miso soup or potato chowder....or tomato basil. Your also ordering sushi at the same time. The pairings were too forced unable to blend seamlessly.\n\nThat leads to me to a comparison of Eurasia versus Elizabeth Street Cafe. Their menu is a play on France's occupation of Vietnam dating back to the late 1800's ending in 1954. Hence, French \/ Vietnamese fusion and ESC does it wonderfully. It's one of my all time favorites by the  powerhouse team at McGuire Moorman Hospitality.\n\nWell, the soup debacle was resolved on a recent visit with my wife. Sadly, some opening lunch favorites were missing from the menu like the potato chip crusted crab cake sandwich. Also missing was the spicy tuna burger on the same bun cooked to perfection. Maybe those lunch options didn't sell that well? New menu has similar sushi options and playfully named entrees.\n\nThis visit started with the wagyu beef empanadas. Small portion (2 per order) with delicately baked exterior. We also had a sushi combo with spicy tuna and Cali rolls with Eurasia's artistic presentation. Speaking of, wife's flying noodles was about the most ridiculous waterfall of carbs stuck on a fork...then elevated again with two chopsticks. Obviously the noodles were a bit cold with the hot broth underneath as a remedy. Def a canidate for Reddit's \"we want plates\" thread. \n\nMy dish (Mandarin Spicy Shrimp) was also good bites. Frankly, the old Asian restaurant (Dynasty Buffet) that used to occupy this space was so bad we called it the die nasty buffet. Eurasia is beyond a step above the previous tenants. Food is creative, sometimes over the top especially in the presentation category, and the interior is bangin' except for the broken bubble wall. Good service, sometimes a sushi cam, and this place is headed in the right direction.",

I ordered the House Ramen and the broth was decent and creamy. The noodles were chewy and fitting but I don't believe they make them themselves. Could be wrong but I think I read that it's a chicken-based broth. The pork cuts were good enough but nothing spectacular and the egg was fully boiled and solid instead of having a more liquid yolk at most authentic Ramen spots. Ramen alone came to a little over $10 which is fine by me. I just couldn't help but wonder if the 2 empty Ramen places directly next to Sapporo would have delivered something just as good without the wait.",

The Sushi is on par in terms of freshness and flavor with the best places I've eaten. My only complaint about the Sushi (and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that the rolls are kind of loose and tend to fall apart. This is the only thing this place has a little room to improve on. That said, I don't really care that much when everything tastes so good. They did a great job with decorating and seating. The atmosphere is really nice. The staff is so friendly and helpful, and I love the \"live sushi cam\" that allows you to watch them making your food.

I ordered a pizza delivery from work.\n\nI will never order from them again.\n\nThe pizza was ok, but the service was awful (and I'm really not a stickler for service...) I ordered a 'Wanna-be' Shi-shi pizza. I had the option of making it green or red (as in pesto or tomato sauce). I was in a VERY green mood, so i went for the pesto. A large part of why I got this pizza was for the... oh, my good ness... I just looked at their new menu online and this misunderstanding might not have been entirely their fault. Well, still giving them the same rating.\n\nNow to continue with the story... I just figured out that I had an old menu... the old menu (which given my source, really could not have been very old and the website says 'new menu' and it's been well over a month, so who knows...) said the pizza had arugula on it, it apparently doesn't anymore, but when it showed up without arugula, I was really disappointed. Also, the other ingredients which could have made up for the lack of leafy greens were not very generously used. There was almost no basil to speak of.\n\nThen when I called Bill's and tried to complain, nobody could understand what I was saying AT ALL. I spoke with one women, she was really confused, and then I got passed without warning to another woman, who started to list ingredients that were clearly for a sandwich. \"Ma'am. I ordered a PIZZA, not a sandwich.\"\n\nAfter a lot of deliberation, I was told they were 'out of arugula' and I could ask for some extra next time I ordered from them. To which I said, 'Please, in the future, let customers know if you don't have all the ingredients for what they ordered, BEFORE you give it to them.' and something about there not going to be a next time, which there won't be.\n\nThat was a bit of a rant, but I'm going to have to agree with someone else who stated that Bill's 'takes their customers for granted.' Now, given that there may have been a menu change that took the arugula off my pizza, this all seems a bit silly, but it really wasn't just me:\n\nA. Shouldn't they know that there's been some recent changes to their menu and not just tell me they're out of arugula??\n\nB. Taking a nice ingredient off a pizza and not changing the price is very uncool.",

While in line, the server will bring you a menu and ask for your order while you're in line, which is very efficient. The annoying thing is that for a group of 4, you HAVE to order 3 ENTREES. This place ONLY ACCEPTS CASH, but $20 should be enough for yourself, they only have Ramen and a few appetizers. I didn't see any signs of soda either, everyone got water.\n\nAs for the entrees, the House Noodles was thick, as well as the broth. I wasn't really sure what to look for since I don't do noodles\/ramens much. The best part is the meat on top, I liked the sweetness that came with it. My favorite is the cold noodles, so much sweetness in it from the surrounding veggies and seaweed salad. It's no soumen, but it'll do for a nice warm day. With the hassle of line and their rule, I don't think I can be a regular here. If you're a fan of ramen, I say give it a shot.",

       "text":"I came here expecting very good fried chicken and I was not disappointed! I ordered Dre's combo, which consisted of 3 drumsticks OR thighs, 4 oz cole slaw, an 8 oz side (I chose Curly's Seasoned Curly Fries), and a drink. For any chicken piece, you can choose regular or dipped in Curly's secret sauce. Students and government workers get a 10% discount ( as long as you have your ID), so my originally $8 combo came out to be $7.7x after tax. \nFirst, the chicken. I was with a friend, who ordered the same thing with the chicken dipped. I ordered mine regular, so each of us could try both. Starting with the regular, the thighs were VERY crisp. The fried skin was not super thickly breaded like you might see at Popeye's, it was little on the thinner side. It could have been slightly more seasoned, but it was very good by itself. I don't know how recently the chicken was fried, but the meat could have been more tender, especially for thighs. \nThen, I tried my friend's dipped version. The sauce more than made up for the seasoning, and just makes it overall much more pleasurable to eat IMO. The sauce is kind of sweet and only a tiny bit spicy. Regardless of if you order dipped or regular, the chicken will come with a little container of the dipping sauce if you just want to try a little bit, or want to have even more sauce with your dipped chicken!\nI was too full to try my coleslaw. My friend got Steve's cajun rice as a side, which was very flavorful. My fries were a bit average in comparison. They're just regular curly fries, the mushy kind you always get. I don't think the additional fried dish had good synergy with my chicken, so that was partially my mistake as well.\nOverall, the value is great. It's really hard to complain when you get this much food for less than $8. If you're not that hungry for a combo, you can get thighs or drumsticks for $2\/each as well as other chicken parts. Sides range from $2-5 I think. I will be back, and I will get a different side with dipped chicken!",

I was thinking that yes, they have a small menu so they can get it right.  Alas, my cranberry bbq turkey tips that sounded so good were overcooked, dry and chewy.  The quinoa didn't look very appealing, and the taste matched the look.  The only thing decent was the grilled asparagus. The coffee I had at the end of the meal was pretty good. The  service was ok.  Looking at a platter of dishes they brought out to a table next to us, there really weren't any dishes that looked all that special.  There is a new one of these near where I live, so of course I am even more disappointed because I was hoping for a good new restaurant to go to.

You can imagine how thrilled I was after moving to the East Coast and discovering that in addition to the thousands of options for pizza night, I also had the option of getting a greek, italian, deep dish, thin crust, on and on and on....\n\nAs a result, my pizza palette has developed tremendously over the past decade. And Bill's delivered to my refined taste. The veggie pizza was a thin crust style, LOADED with fresh veggies, including breaded eggplant (so good), and kalamata olives. \n\nNo offense black olives, but your younger and much tastier sibling is now preferred.\n\nAtmosphere was perfect for a family-style, self serving pizza joint, and alcohol is available. Plenty of room for large parties, and no reservations necessary (after all, you're serving yourself). It's hard to give a pizza joint in Boston more than 3-stars, because there are so many good ones. Don't be afraid to add Bill's to that list.\n\nOh, and FYI: will gladly give a good pizza joint a 4 or 5 star rating if they can get a clown to deliver my pizza. Just sayin'.",

This wasn't so bad, it took about 40 minutes and we got as close as possible on foot before realizing that there really wasn't a pedestrian walkway available to make it to end, and finally the Mansion.  Additionally, the walkway is parallel and at the side of the road, which felt kind of dangerous as there were fast cars, and no other souls on the road walking the trail, but us.  In the end, we had no other choice but to take the bus, and a really nice man actually helped us navigate which stop we needed and also helped us figure out the schedule of when the bus was arriving.  Portland has an amazing public transportation feature in regards to the bus schedules, where you can text and find out when the next bus is due to arrive.  It was such a neat little feature, and I felt as if I were more excited about this than the actual Mansion, ha!  When we finally got there, there was more trekking to do, uphill, and probably .5 miles before you reach the top of the hill where the Mansion sits so prettily.  There's a great view of the city, without question, the vantage point is stunning but, we were so exhausted from the walk that we didn't stay long, and didn't go on any tours or check out the visitor center (I think it was closed by the time we got there anyhow).

       "text":"I discovered this little gem of a spa thanks to Groupon. I had an aromatherapy mani\/pedi and it was great. First off, the decor is lovely--a kind of nouveau Asian. As your feet soak in warm, fragrant water, you are given the option of a warm, lavender-scented neck pillow to help you relax. Take it! Katie was my technician and had lovely, soothing hands. She did my feet first, then my hands, which I appreciated. There is nothing worse then trying to enjoy a pedicure while a manicurist is asking you to contort your body so they can work on your hands. \nI loved the foot and hand scrubs they used. I walked out feeling like a million bucks despite the pouring rain. It's a little pricey, but can you really put a price on pampering?",

       "text":"Alright, having just shopped at both Music Millennium and Everyday Music in the same week, I can objectively compare the two.  While they're both awesome independent music stores, if you put the two of them in a steel cage \"two stores enter, one store leaves\" death match, I'd have my money on EM!\n\nYes, this is my first 5* review of a PDX biz, and all I can say is that EM is my single favorite music store, period.  I've been to Amoeba and Rasputin's in the Bay Area, I've enjoyed Twist & Shout in Denver, all cool in their own right, and probably the equivalent of Music Millennium in my book, but Everyday Music just has that extra something...\n\nPerhaps it's that they file their used and new music together, so you can go to one spot to look for whatever they have of a given artist.  Maybe it's that they have a section of new arrival used discs, separated by day of the week, coyly tempting you to come back weekly (daily?) so you can maybe score that entire \"...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead\" discography that someone brought in last Wednesday.\n\nOr maybe the fact that they pay cash for \"any and all\" used CDs or DVDs, and don't force you into that fool's dilemma of choosing between $6.50 cash or $9.25 credit (\"lunch today, or a CD tomorrow?\"). Plus, unlike selling books at Powell's, EM tells you how much they'll give you for each individual item (\"you're only offering me $1.00 for 'Ned's Atomic Dustbin'? No thanks!\").\n\nYeah, if you try and sell your Shaquille O'Neal - \"Shaq Diesel\" disc they may only offer you a quarter, but at least it's not that humiliating \"We can't take this\" (translated: \"I can't believe you own this, get out of my store and never come back\").\n\nAnd you have to love the fact that they sell \"SKUFs\" (discs with visible scratches or damage) for even less $$ than other used CDs; the last one I got was $4.25!  Sometimes you're taking a gamble with a SKUF, but ALL their music (including SKUFs) are 100% guaranteed to play; if you have a problem they will let you exchange it or give you a store credit.  If given the choice I ALWAYS buy SKUFs, and I've only once had to return one.\n\nI also dig their laid back, open, and casual store layouts.  I've been to all 3 of their PDX locations, and they are universally cavernous and simple to navigate.  You don't have people crawling over your back when you want to spend hours pouring over every disc on the shelf looking for that gem.  Sure, it's a bit antiseptic (aside from the posters) and lacks the character of Music Millennium's cozy confines, but it's way more feng shui and pleasant to wander aimlessly or with purpose.\n\nOh, and every location is open 'til midnight, 365 days a year!\n\nOf course they have listening stations so you can check out new bands or the quality of a used disc before your purchase.  They don't sell much beyond recorded music, except for the odd music accessories - like blank media, stylish headphones, or empty jewel-cases - and that's just the way I like it.\n\nThe kicker, last weekend after buying a few discs we noticed their dumpster outside was full of used tapes.  It was like searching for music through the best yard sale you've ever seen, and not having to pay a penny for what you found.  The fact that I drove home listening to \"Rico Suave\" is a treasure that has earned EM my undying love and devotion!\n\nHands down awesome!  I love Everyday Music, and you should too!",

       "text":"After chasing the elusive lobster roll all over the first half of my week in the area I finally got my hands on one in a small local place with a pretty good reputation.  It was quite yummy but it was missing something.  You see, they served it on a hoagie roll that was just a plain roll.  Not buttered, not toasted, nothing but plain.\n\nAnd that, my friends, brings me to why I ate an airport lobster roll.  Legal Seafoods is known for serving up a great lobster roll.  The biggest difference as far as I could tell was in the bread component of the dish.  They butter and griddle their bread to the point where it adds a certain sweetness in addition to the snap associated with the consistency of the toasted bread.  And that was what made this the better lobster roll of the two...by a long shot.\n\nClam chowder is also damn good.\n\nYes, the place is expensive but the next time I find myself in the area I will probably be eating my lobster roll at one of the Legal Seafood locations and enjoying plenty of other local cuisine elsewhere.",

       "text":"I agree with Kris that this BMV (or DMV, as I'm more used to calling it) is less horrible than most. I was impressed with it's lack of skeeziness and the relatively quick and painless waiting\/test taking\/registration acquiring that I had to endure. \n\nI finalllllllllllly bought a (used!) car after five years of flippant protest (well, GWB is out of office, I feel a little less like I'm participating in some grotesque perversion of the American dream). Turns out, you actually have to eventually switch your license to Ohio after you register your car and get Ohizz plates. Okay, so I studied like a maniac since I'm not the best test-taker in the world. Ohio's laws are actually pretty lax and easy to understand compared to other places I've taken the test (Maine = fail times five before finally passing, Illinois = almost fail). \n\nApparently, the testing computers were down when we arrived (computer testing = new for me, scary), and the first woman I spoke with didn't seem to understand that even though my license is from IL, the car I bought is from Ohizz, but we finally straightened everything out and figured out that I could get real plates (not temps) if I promised to change my license over ASAP. She was very nice, and the wait was short, but I was about to have a heart attack the whole time because \"authority\" (not this woman specifically) and \"bureaucracy\" annoy the h out of me... \n\nAnyway, we waited a relatively short amt. of time again to get the plates, and when I got them I was informed that the computers were working again, so much to my simultaneous chagrin\/joy, I got to take the test, right away, without waiting. \n\nThe Ohizz driver's license test is actually very easy, especially if you already know how to drive. There are a few laws that are specific to Ohio, at least compared to other places I've lived (riding in the back of a pickup is NOT illegal, but if you're under 16, the truck must be going under 25mph haaaa; Ohio DOESN'T have a zero tolerance law???). The format of the test was difficult for me personally, because it was on a computer, multiple choice, and also in an area that wasn't completely quiet (guess who has ADD?!). But, I passed that beast anyway, and look like I have hives in my new license pic, heh. \n\nI'm relating this because I wish someone had given me a detailed account of how this works in Ohio. It's a lot less intimidating than any DMV experience I've ever had - people told me that, but I really do think that most people are better at understanding this type of test than I am. So, good news, test-failers and those with short concentration! It's really not bad here. \n\nAlso, remember that you can take a left turn on red if you're turning from a one-way to a one-way. I got that one right cuz I read the manual. Like five times. :D",

I got the basic car wash with inside \"cleaning\" & was there for all of 10 mins b\/c my car wasn't washed properly. I'd just come back from a road trip so my grill was dirty & full of dead bugs. When they brought my car around the grill was half cleaned, the windshield had dirty spots left at the bottom from where it'd rained previously and my console or dash wasn't wiped or cleaned! It's cheap but I could have done a better job myself! For free! Then to put the icing on the cake the guy that gave me my car ASKED for a tip! I didn't have any cash but had I did I would not have seen it fit to leave them ANYTHING extra. I mean who ASKS for a tip? Yikes.",

       "text":"I attended a 3-day conference here, but had no need to stay overnight since I live in the ATX, so this review is hotel as meeting venue. \n\nIck. \n\nFor one thing, finding the place is ridiculously confusing, even for someone who has lived here for ten years. Take the wrong turn and you're doomed to be stuck in the horror of south I-35 parking lot traffic, as there is no way to turn around for another long, crawling mile or so. Yeah, taking the wrong turn was my fault, but, well, anyway. \n\nI finally got there, late, on the first day. After finally finding a parking spot in the garage, which was free (good for 1 star), I found the meeting room, but was confused, since there was a large contingency of TX DOT folks milling around the area, yakking and visiting vendor's booths. I had to go back to the lobby and ask the concierge where our meeting was. Oh. right smack dab in the middle of all this. \n\nSo the meeting room. Large, nice, cold air-conditioning (a good thing this hideous desert fall), but windowless, drab, and really in need of a makeover. Our purpose was to read, read, read and review testing items for the new state exam (high school reading) coming up. So reading for hours and hours in a room with no natural light and nothing but fluorescent lights glaring down upon us makes for tired eyes (and cranky educators). \n\nMeh. \n\nDay 1: I was pumped that breakfast and lunch would be provided for us, but disappointed at the results. On that first day, they served roast beef with brown gravy, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, and a mediocre salad. Really? A super heavy lunch for people who are sitting around all day? I opted for the roast beef, which was cold (why??bring it out hot, folks, and the chafing dishes might keep it warm) and pretty much flavorless, and the salad, which was just OK. \n\nDay 2: I came in early for breakfast, which consisted of (cold) scrambled eggs, flour tortillas, roasted potatoes and onions (good!), and some grated cheese and lame salsa. Wow. Around 11 a.m., I snuck out of the room and took a peek at the lunch offerings - barbecue chicken, mushy potato salad, liquid cole slaw, white bread-and decided on my escape plan: walk next door and have some fish at Pappadeux. Good decision. \n\nDay 3: I tried the breakfast again with the same result. The meeting was over by noon, so I didn't sample the hamburgers that were available. \n\nAfter reading the other reviews, all I can add is, WAKE UP, DOUBLETREE! You're keeping Austin Icky.",

I walked down at 11:30, the scheduled pickup time, and was told that the order had accidentally been cancelled. That's fine, accidents happen, but ZERO attempt had been made to call us back to let us know, and zero attempt had been made to recreate the order. Also, when I walked in the employees--four of them--were chit chatting in the front instead of helping customers. I have literally never experienced that level of unprofessionalism in my life. Unbelievable. It was a $90 order, too.

The storyline, the puzzles, the presentation of the rooms and the staff were all incredible.  At least for Lethal Virus, the puzzles are thought out so that you're not all staring at one person doing a single thing but it's made so that everyone can figure out different things and help each other out in a teamwork fashion, which is the way it should be.

The meat counter at the entrance-exit is an unusual decor choice, but it gives you the chance to take home any of the restaurant's fresh sausages. \n\nAlthough there are numerous entree options, the Autobahn Buffet is a fine deal. For $14.95 you get a warm potato salad (fine), macaroni and cheese (golden, gooey, but sorta Kraft-ish), corned beef and cabbage (deeelicious), sauerkraut (nice and fragrant with caraway, but I didn't come across any of those annoying caraway seeds!), Bahama Mama and Bahama Mama mild sausages (both niiiice, with a pop when you bite them), bratwurst (fine), knockwurst (yum), sausage stew (sausage so-so, but the brown gravy was really flavorful), cooked red cabbage (fine), smashed red potatoes (nicely smashed, but not memorable), meatloaf (already forgot it), a small salad bar with typical ingredients plus a soup, and green beens (no typo). The large beer selection includes the very good and locally brewed Haus brew German Village Gold. As a Wisconsin State Fair veteran, I didn't think the cream puffs were unusually large, but the blueberry whipped cream center (one of several flavor choices for an additional $3) would hold its own in any competition. The Apple Strudel was another fine choice. All in all, a fine experience.",

My grandmother's recipes knock Schmidt's out of the park in my opinion.  Maybe it should be called \"Grandma Alice's\" instead.  :)  I don't know, the food is just really heavy and either too strong or too bland, and there is ALOT of it.  Seriously.  Take some Beano or whatever helps you with, erm....you know...because you will have it after you leave Schmidt's.  And be prepared to pay a pretty penny.\n\nEveryone know's about Schmidt's and wants to bring their out of town guests here, so plan to arrive at least an hour early.  They don't take reservations, so put your name in ASAP and enjoy walking around the adorable German Village while you wait.  The gift shop down the street offers free coffee and tea which is so hospitable!  They also have cute gifts from local Ohio artisans. Schiller park is beautiful and just a few blocks away.\n\nSorry, back to Schmidt's  - the highlight?  Most definitely the cream puffs, specifically the chocolate one.  Also, get your picture taken in the lederhosen picture board.  And you'll get a laugh if you go the restroom - German translations for popular movie quotes on the loud speaker.  :)\n\nOh and PS - if you are in Columbus, agree with me, that the cream puffs are the best (and if you're crazy for their brats and sauerkraut) - they have food truck!

Brunch starts at 10:00 Am and gets busy pretty quickly, I would recommend making reservations.\n\nThe menu items change on a weekly basis but some of the stations remain constant (made to order omelette station, carving station, fruit station, salad station, HUGE dessert station, pastry station along with many breakfast and lunch entrees.) \n\nThe omelette station was cool. Instead of waiting in line, we marked our order on a piece of paper and a food runner brought it to our table once it was ready.\n\nThere were two different pancakes, the buttermilk version and an apple spice version.\n\nThe egg benedicts were colossal and delicious. I went with the version with pulled pork and coleslaw.  The poached egg was perfect and the yolk dripped nicely over my English muffin when I cut through it.\n\nThe salad station looked good but I went for other fatty foods instead.\n\nWe were totally stuffed and didn't have any room for dessert. Since the display was so beautiful and enticing, we somehow made room.  There was cakes, cookies, cannoilis, whoopie pies, doughnuts and even a make your own sundae bar.\n\nWe'll definitely be back! I think the brunch is great to celebrate with family of friends. They can even accommodate large parties in their \"semi-private\" space in the rear dining area.\n\nAll you can eat brunch is available every Sunday from 10:00 AM- 2:30 PM. (I'd recommend getting there early to get dibs on desserts!)\n\nPrice is $18.99 and includes a soda or coffee\/tea (extra for OJ) If you wanted to imbibe with your brunch, the bloody mary's and mimosas looked amazing1\n\nThe brunch is  held at Tavern in the Square Burlington, Allston, Central Square, Northborouh, Porter Square and Salem.\n\nService was super friendly. Management help with running of the foods and asked if everything was OK. Other servers and food runners were helpful and working as a team to turn the tables over quicker.  On our way out, about 5 different staff members thanks us for coming in and told us to have a great day\n\n*note: that whole area is going through major renovation\/construction. Traffic might be cumbersome and parking might be limited. There's also detours that you have to work around.\n\nFor pics, visit\nhttp:\/\/www.mami-eggroll.com\/2015\/10\/sunday-brunch-at-tavern-in-square.html",

       "text":"Crowded restaurant did not live up to its hype.  This place is very popular, but that does not necessarily equate to great food.  \n\nFor example, the beef noodle soup featured almost nothing but gristle, connective tissue and fat, and the broth had an oil slick on the surface as a result.  What very little meat was actually present tasted mediocre at best.  The noodles were limp and the soup lacked kick.  Probably the worst I've had, and I've had a dozen beef noodle soups in the last month.\n\nThe Xiao Long Baos tasted good, but they were very small and several came out super deformed.  (Take a look at my photos.)  The beef wrap that people raved about tasted good, but the wrap had a crackled surface that flaked off very easily.  This did not affect the taste which is what matters most, but it made for a messy dining experience.\n\nAnd it was my first time ever trying Tan Tan noodles, but it will probably be my last.  Why do people seem to enjoy a noodle in a peanut broth that has no meat or other toppings, yet costs as much as other noodles?  The taste didn't work for me, and this dish rates very low on my bang-for-the-buck scale.\n\nThe service was as good as you can expect when the restaurant is packed like it was on our visit.  Kudos to the three waitresses who were hustling to serve their customers.  We spent over $30 (tax and tip) for the four aforementioned items which was a major disappointment.  I've eaten more, eaten better and paid less at many other establishments.",

Very delicious.\n\nThe ramen is great as well- I highly recommend spicy miso!\n\nThe service is funny. There is one AzN lady who runs the show.

       "text":"When we moved from our old neighborhood on 5th St. to Ponce we were very eager to try Papi's.  The smells!  Oh the smells!  They were fantastic!  They made my nose hairs dance with joy.  Too much?  Ok.  But it really does smell great.  I ordered the pollo cuban sandwich, only I prefer mine with no lettuce, onions, and tomatoes or anything else.  Just give me chicken and onions on some of that great Cuban bread.  Oh, and don't forget the side of black beans so I can mound them on my sandwich, too.  MMMMMMM!  I find it funny because every time I go and order the pollo cuban sandwich and I tell them \"chicken and onions ONLY please\" they have a discussion about it that goes something like this:  \"Chicken and onions?  No pickle?  No tomato?  Just chicken and onions?\"  \"Yes, just chicken and onions.\"  \"Chicken and onions, and that's it?\"  \"Yes, just chicken and onions.  That's it.\"  My hubby orders the ropa vieja sandwich and always loves it.   \n\nWe usually get take out but on the rare occasion we dine in I always remember why we get take out.  I don't mind a little noise but downstairs is pretty loud because the sound echos.  Once we were seated next to a family of four and we couldn't hear each other speaking from across the table.  That being said, it is certainly not a reason to avoid Papi's.  Plus, we can be really lazy and love having to only walk across the street for something great to eat.",

       "text":"Let me open with I love Vietnamese food.  I had seen the reviews for VietRiver and was excited to find a good place to go (according to the reviews I found online.)\n\nI  ordered the chicken Pho.  Upon arriving at my table I immediately noticed an overpowering smell coming from the broth.  I could not recognize what it was but it was offputting.  Irregardless, I dug in hoping that it would taste better than it smelled.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  The chicken was bland, obviously been boiled, and whatever the smell was permeated the taste of the broth.  Never before had I ever sent my food back to a restaurant kitchen but this Pho was inedible.  The manager came to my table and explained that the Pho was made in a traditional manner with 11 herbs and I must not be used to the combination of flavors.  I thought that was most unprofessional to blame the customer for an untrained palate.  I have eaten in Vietnamese restaurants that the menu was only in Vietnamese!  \n\nAs a substitute, I ordered the summer rolls.  Better but not much.  The pork was very chewy and the shrimp small.  The noodles were soggy and the majority of the roll was filled with iceburg lettuce, with minimal herbs.  The peanut sauce although tasted fine looked curdled.\n\nI will not return to this restaurant.",

It is with trepidation that I considered buying a luxury watch online, but after spending hours researching options, concluded that this may be the only way to buy an authentic, never worn, new in-box with all paperwork, luxury watch at a 15% discount, plus no sales tax, which saved me another 9.5%. I called to ask questions, and P.J. had a nice voice and was helpful, and my watch, from the current production line, was shipped within twelve hours of ordering. According to the watch enthusiast forums I read, they apparently have a sterling reputation; if I had found any inkling that they sold fake watches or watch parts I would not have bought from them. I was additionally happy because by paying via Amazon fulfillment, I could use Amex, which means both buyer protection and points. If only I were more often in the market for nice watches, for I can see how people get obsessed... but at least I can refer others to them.",

       "text":"Schmidt's.\n\nIf you haven't been there, you either hate cream puffs and sausage - or you're a vegetarian. We arrived close to opening on a Saturday for lunch before a downtown matinee show. Tip: get there around opening unless you enjoy hanging out for 45 minutes to an hour to be seated. My niece is working on becoming vegetarian, and I agreed to stand in solidarity with her for lunch.\n\nFolks, struggle is REAL at Schmidt's if you are attempting to forego meat and\/or meat products. There are no vegetarian items on the menu. They do offer green salad, red cabbage, and sauerkraut on the buffet, so you'll get your daily allotment of green veggies. Soup of the day - ham and bean. They do have pretzel bites as an appetizer. I got my fill of sides, no problem.\n\nBut really, we all know Schmidt's has awesome sausage, and the spouse ordered a chicken schnitzel that was covered with garlic cloves. Looked delicious, but I stayed strong and grabbed another round of salad.\n\n(Disclaimer: Not a fan of cream puffs. But they have a BUNCH of other treats - the cherry cheesecake and the coconut cream pie were fantastic. No need to hold back on those for health reasons, right?)",
